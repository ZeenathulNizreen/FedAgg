The work happens in a freelance manner - if you like setting your own schedule this could appeal to you, but the flip side would be that your work bleeds more into your weekends and evenings. Some people also would love the idea of pursuing their hobbies and interest full time, but when they have to treat it as their job, soon become disenchanted. \n\nIn summary, your decision to become an influencer should be based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and personal working style and interests.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What are the best brunch places in Burlingame, CA?", "context": "", "response": "Crepevine, Stacks, Coopenhagen, Mints and Honey, Alanas, and Caffe Central.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "When did Singapore achieve independence?", "context": "", "response": "Singapore first achieved independence from British rule on 16 September 1963, through a merger with Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak.

In Canada, the term automated banking machine (ABM) is also used, although ATM is also very commonly used in Canada, with many Canadian organizations using ATM over ABM. In British English, the terms cashpoint, cash machine and hole in the wall are most widely used. Other terms include any time money, cashline, tyme machine, cash dispenser, cash corner, bankomat, or bancomat. ATMs that are not operated by a financial institution are known as \"white-label\" ATMs.\n\nUsing an ATM, customers can access their bank deposit or credit accounts in order to make a variety of financial transactions, most notably cash withdrawals and balance checking, as well as transferring credit to and from mobile phones. ATMs can also be used to withdraw cash in a foreign country. If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that in which the bank account is denominated, the money will be converted at the financial institution's exchange rate. Customers are typically identified by inserting a plastic ATM card (or some other acceptable payment card) into the ATM, with authentication being by the customer entering a personal identification number (PIN), which must match the PIN stored in the chip on the card (if the card is so equipped), or in the issuing financial institution's database.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What temperature does water boil at in Celsius and Fahrenheit", "context": "", "response": "Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius and 212 degrees Fahrenheit", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Name some of the bravolebrities from The Real Housewives of Dubai", "context": "", "response": "Caroline Brooks, Caroline Stanbury, Chanel Ayan, Dr. Sara Al Madani, Lesa Milan Hall and Nina Ali", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What team has won the most Stanley Cups?", "context": "", "response": "The Montreal Canadiens have won the most Stanley Cups with 24.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Which NFL team has the most Super Bowl championship wins?", "context": "", "response": "The Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots are tied for the most Super Bowl championship wins.

Bank reserves are held as cash in the bank or as balances in the bank's account at the central bank. The country's central bank determines the minimum amount that banks must hold in liquid assets, called the \"reserve requirement\" or \"reserve ratio\". Most commercial banks hold more than this minimum amount as excess reserves.\n\nBank deposits are usually of a relatively short-term duration, and may be \"at call\", while loans made by banks tend to be longer-term, resulting in a risk that customers may at any time collectively wish to withdraw cash out of their accounts in excess of the bank reserves. The reserves only provide liquidity to cover withdrawals within the normal pattern. Banks and the central bank expect that in normal circumstances only a proportion of deposits will be withdrawn at the same time, and that reserves will be sufficient to meet the demand for cash. However, banks may find themselves in a shortfall situation when depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. In that event, the bank experiencing the liquidity shortfall may borrow short-term funds in the interbank lending market from banks with a surplus.

Originally, the term epistasis specifically meant that the effect of a gene variant is masked by that of a different gene.\n\nThe concept of epistasis originated in genetics in 1907 but is now used in biochemistry, computational biology and evolutionary biology. The phenomenon arises due to interactions, either between genes (such as mutations also being needed in regulators of gene expression) or within them (multiple mutations being needed before the gene loses function), leading to non-linear effects.

Since 1914, black smoke (fumata nera) emerging from a temporary chimney installed on the roof of the Sistine Chapel indicates that the ballot did not result in an election, while white smoke (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope has been chosen.\n\nPrior to 1945 (when Pius XII changed the form of ballot to use unsigned ballots, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above had the effect of making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. The lack of sealing wax on the ballots explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 conclave. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color on the first day of that conclave.\n\nSince 1963, chemicals have been added to the burning process to augment the smoke's black or white color.

Singlish arose out of a situation of prolonged language contact between speakers of many different languages in Singapore, including Hokkien, Malay, Teochew, Cantonese and Tamil.\n\nSinglish originated with the arrival of the British and the establishment of English-medium education in Singapore. Elements of English quickly filtered out of schools and onto the streets, resulting in the development of a pidgin language spoken by non-native speakers as a lingua franca used for communication between speakers of the many different languages used in Singapore. Singlish evolved mainly among the working classes who learned elements of English without formal schooling, mixing in elements of their native languages. After some time, this new pidgin language, now combined with substantial influences from Indian English, Peranakan, southern varieties of Chinese, Malay, and Tamil, became the primary language of the streets. As Singlish grew in popularity, children began to acquire Singlish as their native language, a process known as creolization. Through this process of creolization, Singlish became a fully-formed, stabilized and independent creole language, acquiring a more robust vocabulary and more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding.\n\nSinglish shares many linguistic similarities with Manglish or Bazaar Malay of Malaysia, although a few distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary. Manglish generally receives more Malay influence and Singlish more Chinese (Mandarin, Hokkien, etc.) influence. Initially, Singlish and Manglish were essentially the same dialect evolving from the British Malaya economy, born in the trading ports of Singapore, Malacca and Penang when Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia were for many purposes a de facto (from 1963 to 1965, de jure) single entity. Ever since the two countries separated, a divergence has been observed.\n\nLike all languages, Singlish and other creole languages show consistent internal logic and grammatical complexity. Due to its origins, Singlish shares many similarities with other English-based creole languages. As with many other creole languages, it is sometimes incorrectly perceived to be a \"broken\" form of the lexifier language - in this case, English.

Owing to differences in composition and fluoride content, not all toothpastes are equally effective in maintaining oral health. The decline of tooth decay during the 20th century has been attributed to the introduction and regular use of fluoride-containing toothpastes worldwide.

Sounds pretty depressing right? Well, there are a number of reasons why one might feel this way. Do you ever feel like you are just going through the motions each day? You wake up, go to work, get off work, sleep, and the cycle continues. You chased after a goal, such as graduating college or getting that next promotion, thinking it would solve all your problems, only to be disappointed after finally getting it. Then you look around the universe that you lives in and find how insignificant your individuality is in the grand schemes of things, you can't help but think to yourself: man, is there any point to life? Does what I do actually matter at all, especially if I'm going to die anyways? \n\nIf you ever feel this way, know that you are not alone. Many, many philosophers throughout human history have pondered upon this very idea. I'll present a select few philosophers and their proposals to fight against nihilism.\n\nOne obvious solution, per Danish philosophers Kierkegaard, is religion. He believes that faith should be our purpose in life, following Him and doing good in this life will reap rewards in the afterlife. \n\nNow, German philosopher Nietzsche does not agree with that at all; in fact his most famous quote was \"God is dead and we killed him\". He's talking about how with new advances in science comes the death of religion -- each man must now create his own values and become an ubermensch. The idea of ubermensch, however, kind of throws morality out of window \u2014 who is to say one\u2019s value is wrong?\n\nEnter Albert Camus and his idea of absurdism. He compares human life to Sisyphus \u2014 rolling a giant rock uphill, only for the rock to fall back down after reaching the top \u2014 an absurd and meaningless struggle. He suggests that we accept the absurdity of this world and human existence, and instead embrace the present, because \u201cThe struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy\u201d.\n\nAnd there you have it, what nihilism is all about, why it happens and a few ways to fight against it.

Mitochondria have a double membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. They were discovered by Albert von K\u00f6lliker in 1857  in the voluntary muscles of insects. The term mitochondrion was coined by Carl Benda in 1898. The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the \"powerhouse of the cell\", a phrase coined by Philip Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.\n\nSome cells in some multicellular organisms lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A large number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids and diplomonads, have reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. One eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria, and one multicellular organism, Henneguya salminicola, is known to have retained mitochondrion-related organelles in association with a complete loss of their mitochondrial genome.\n\nMitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 \u03bcm2 in cross section, but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human disorders and conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and autism.\n\nThe number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism, tissue, and cell type. A mature red blood cell has no mitochondria, whereas a liver cell can have more than 2000. The mitochondrion is composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, cristae, and matrix.\n\nAlthough most of a eukaryotic cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own genome (\"mitogenome\") that is substantially similar to bacterial genomes. This finding has led to general acceptance of the endosymbiotic hypothesis - that free-living prokaryotic ancestors of modern mitochondria permanently fused with eukaryotic cells in the distant past, evolving such that modern animals, plants, fungi, and other eukaryotes are able to respire to generate cellular energy.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What are some of the most popular tourist attractions to visit in Sydney?", "context": "", "response": "Sydney has many famous landmarks and attractions, with the most famous being the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House, situated on the foreshore of Sydney harbour.

As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret the biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using computational and statistical techniques.\n\nBioinformatics includes biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as specific analysis \"pipelines\" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of genomics. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidates genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Often, such identification is made with the aim to better understand the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organizational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences, called proteomics.\n\nImage and signal processing allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed mutations. It plays a role in the text mining of biological literature and the development of biological and gene ontologies to organize and query biological data. It also plays a role in the analysis of gene and protein expression and regulation. Bioinformatics tools aid in comparing, analyzing and interpreting genetic and genomic data and more generally in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology.

In tennis, players also hit the ball back and forth but they hit it to each other over a net. In tennis, the ball has a fuzzy outer layer which causes the ball's trajectory to be more influenced by the spin on the ball.

The acquiring bank then pays the merchant the amount of the transaction minus both the interchange fee and an additional, usually smaller, fee for the acquiring bank or independent sales organization (ISO), which is often referred to as a discount rate, an add-on rate, or passthru. For cash withdrawal transactions at ATMs, however, the fees are paid by the card-issuing bank to the acquiring bank (for the maintenance of the machine).", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Who founded the city of Detroit?", "context": "", "response": "The site that was to become the city of Detroit was established on July 24, 1701, by Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, a French military leader and trader.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Where was poutine invented?", "context": "", "response": "While it is the national dish of Quebec (a province of Canada) there are multiple cities that are claiming that poutine is from that city.

The statue had an inscription identifying it as an image of Helios, the god of the sun and local deity to Rhodes. In the wider Ancient Greek world Helios would likely be identified more readily as Apollo. The statue may have been made in the likeness of Alexander the Great's official image. This would have served to represent a bond between Rhodes and Alexandria with Alexander's image serving as the founder of the Egyptian city. Support for this idea comes from the fact that the Colossus was made to celebrate Rhodes' victory over a siege. This victory was largely facilitated by Ptolemy from Alexandria, and Alexandria is also a likely source for the funds of the ambitious project. The artist Chares of Lindos would also have been well selected to achieve this double representation. He was local to the island of Rhodes (Lindos is another city on the same island) and would have been familiar with images of Helios. He was also the student of Lysippos who was the exclusive personal sculptor to Alexander the Great during his lifetime, and so Chares would have also been uniquely knowledgeable about the image of Alexander. Some but not all scholars argue for the Colossus to be understood as an image of Alexander posing as Helios that would be seen by the people of Rhodes as their local deity but seen by the people of Alexandria as their founder. The Statue of Liberty built by France and gifted to the USA was partially modeled after the Colossus and is similarly possible to read as a celebration of American independence and also a reference to one the three values Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9 and Fraternit\u00e9 central to French identity.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What are the best hikes near Portland Oregon.", "context": "", "response": "There are many hikes near Portland Oregon, especially on the Columbia River Gorge.

In this practice, the caretaker will teach signs to the baby every time the baby eliminates in the toilet (not in a diaper) - the baby will eventually pick up these signs and give cues when they need to go.  Those that subscribe to infant potty training believe that conventional diapers train babies to ignore their natural instincts by removing the discomfort one would normally sense from having wet skin (achieved by chemicals that absorb liquid and wick moisture away from the skin found in many disposable diapers).

When he does get the home on the water fall, it is clear that he is not satisfied. He can say that the dog nor Kevin are his problems. But when he sits down in his beloved chair, and looks through Ellie book of adventure again, he realizes that Ellie lived her adventures. She had no regrets. Her life was an adventure.

The main advantage of braising is that it causes the collagen in the meat fibers to break down into gelatin, which makes the meat fibers more separated and thus the meat more tender. In addition, the gelatin mixes with the remaining cooking liquids to create a scrumptious sauce. Thus, the overall process transforms meat from tough into tender, along with a tasty sauce that can be served alongside the meat. Braising is also convenient in that the cook does not have to attend frequently to the food during the cooking process.

One of the most significant changes is the decrease in muscle mass and strength. This loss of muscle mass is known as sarcopenia and can start as early as age 30, with a more rapid decline after age 60. This may lead many people to believe that gaining muscle after 35 is impossible, but is that really the case?\nYes, it's possible to build muscle after 35\n\nThe short answer is yes, it is possible to build muscle after 35. In fact, strength training can be just as effective for older adults as it is for younger ones. It's never too late to start working on your fitness goals and building the body you want.\n\nThe benefits of building muscle after 35\n\nAs we age, building muscle becomes increasingly important for several reasons. First and foremost, it can help us maintain our independence and mobility as we age. Strong muscles can help us with everyday activities like carrying groceries or getting up from a chair. Building muscle can also help prevent injuries and falls, which can be more dangerous as we get older.\n\nAdditionally, building muscle can help improve our overall health. Muscle is more metabolically active than fat, which means it burns more calories at rest. This can help us maintain a healthy weight and lower our risk of developing chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.\n\nHow to build muscle after 35\n\nSo, how exactly do you go about building muscle after 35? The key is to focus on strength training exercises that target multiple muscle groups. Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses are great for building overall strength and muscle mass.\nIt's also important to gradually increase the weight and intensity of your workouts over time. This will help you continue to make progress and avoid plateauing. Additionally, be sure to give your muscles time to rest and recover between workouts.\n\nFinally, proper nutrition is crucial for building muscle at any age. Make sure you're getting enough protein, as this is essential for muscle growth and repair. Aim for at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.\n\nBuilding muscle after 35 is definitely possible, and it comes with a variety of benefits. Strength training can help improve our overall health, prevent injury, and maintain our independence as we age.

The malting process renders the grain usable to the brewer. It's basically taking a live seed, steeping it in water and tricking it into thinking it's time to grow.\" The grain starts to ready itself to grow into a plant but the germination is then stopped by drying the barley. Malting helps to create the enzymes necessary to convert the starches present in the seeds into sugars. Without malting, the beer would not have enough sugar content to properly ferment.\n\nThe malted barley is crushed or milled and then soaked in warm water in order to create a sugar solution known as wort. Any other grains used in the brewing process are also added at this point. Soaking the grains in warm water helps to further convert the starches into the sugars necessary for fermentation.\n\nThe wort is then moved to a copper pot and boiled. During boiling, some of the water in the wort evaporates, leaving behind a higher concentration of sugars. Boiling also helps to sterilize the mixture in preparation for fermentation. \n\nAfter boiling, the solid hops and grain are removed, and the mixture is cooled. The brewers then add yeast to this mixture. Fermenting with yeast is what makes beer alcoholic. The time it takes to ferment a beer varies based on type of yeast and style of fermentation, but most beers take about a week to ferment.\n\nDifferent strains of yeast and different fermentation techniques determine what kind of beer is being made and how it will taste. For example, when making a lager, the yeast ferments at the bottom of the wort at a cooler temperature. Ales are made with a different strain of yeast, and top fermented at warmer temperatures.

For example, a prism separates white light into a spectrum of colors, and a mirror reflects the light entirely. When it passes through the atmosphere, light gets scattered. If unimpeded, the light of the sun is white.\n\nBlue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors of light, and it scatters more easily. It is this scattering which makes it perceptible to the human eye.When the sun starts to set, the light is passing through even more atmosphere, and yet further colors are visible (such as orange and red).\n\nYou can read more at https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/, where I researched this answer.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "How does a transistor amplify a signal?", "context": "", "response": "A transistor is a constructed from materials that behave as semiconductors--which is to say that these materials conduct electrical current but only when certain conditions are met. By combining these materials into a device called a transistor we are able to create an electronic component that will only conduct electricity when a small electric current is applied to the so-called Base pin of the transistor.\n\nOne obvious use of such behavior is to use the transistor as a switch--by applying or removing current to the base pin we are able to control whether the transistor conducts electricity via its collector and emitter pins. When no current is present at the Base pin the transistor will block electrical transmission through its emitter and collector pins.\n\nGenerally speaking, the electrical current required to control the transistor at the base pin is very small. Much larger currents can be transferred through the device through the collector and emitter pins. Thus, in effect, a transistor uses a very small input current to control the flow of a much larger current.\n\nAn audio signal, for example, is transmitted as a very low power electrical current--in it's original form it is too small to be able to drive a loudspeaker to make sounds that are audible to the human ear. To amplify this signal so that is usable for audio playback we can apply the audio signal to a transistor's base pin--this will allow a much larger current to flow between the emitter and collector pins and through the transistor. Since the flow of this large current will mirror the much smaller current of the audio signal we will have effectively created a much stronger version of the original input signal.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "How long is a running ultra?", "context": "", "response": "The term ultra applies to any foot race longer than a marathon.

The earth is mostly water and the water \"points\" at the moon, the parts of the Earth experiencing high tide is the water drawing towards the moon. The \"pointing\" water that faces the moon is formed because the gravitational pull of the moon is strongest on whichever side of the Earth faces it. Gravity pulls the ocean towards the moon and high tide occurs.\n\nThe bulge on the far side of the Earth is caused by inertia. The water moving away from the moon resists the gravitational forces that attempt to pull it in the opposite direction. Because the gravitational pull of the moon is weaker on the far side of the Earth, inertia wins, the ocean bulges out and high tide occurs.

It is best to consult an experienced boot fitter to ensure the boot is set up correctly. Once you've ensured the boot is set up correctly, it is likely a technique issue. A common cause of A-frame is a result of rotating the outside knee inside more than the inside knee, and this can happen due to wider skis or wanting to create a bigger edge angle. Ideally, we should avoid over-rotating the knee inside as this creates a weaker position and instead rely on moving the hip and upper body into the inside of the turn to create a bigger edge angle and try to keep the outside leg relatively straight.\n\nA good exercise to practice this is the T-drill, where you try to make sure your outside leg is as straight as possible and create edge angle by leaning your whole body into the turn, you'll need to shorten your inside leg by bringing your need to your chest, which will then still allow you to balance mostly on your straight downhill leg.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What songs are on the AC/DC album Back in Black?", "context": "", "response": "1.

But assuming one has found the right person, there are comparative advantages and disadvantages to marrying at a young age or an older age. Men have the advantage of not needing to worry about the 'biological clock' - unlike women, their reproductive age can extend into quite a late age, whereas women typically lose the ability to reproduce once they hit around the age of 40. An advantage of having children when one is young is that a man will have more energy and physical dexterity to be able to engage in physical activities with his children, like camping, biking, hiking, sports, skiing, etc. Bending over to change diapers will not be as painful on the back and knees. As a younger man, travel with children may be less discomforting. As an older man, one might have more time or flexibility of time to spend with one's children. An older man may also have greater financial resources to help make child raising easier. For example, an older man might have a larger house, or a greater ability to afford in-house child care. On the other hand, there are studies that show having an older father may increase the odds of a child having autism or attention deficit disorder. Anecdotally, it seems people who marry at a young age are more likely to divorce. But perhaps having two marriages, one when one is young and another when one is older, is not a bad thing. Men have the advantage of being able to sire two sets of children at different times in their lives, making this possible.

One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation.

Specifically, in the context of business intelligence, you are typically presenting facts and insights about a business to stakeholders in order for them to take action and make better decisions to run that business. \n\nGood data visualisation combines user experience design with an understanding of how people interpret data to provide something intuitive and compelling for the intended audience to use. \n\nHere are some examples of design and interpretation choices you might make:\n\nIn terms of design, many cultures write on a page from top to bottom, left to right. This means that the first place on any visualisation that a person from any of these cultures will look is top left. Consequently, the content you put in the top left space of your dashboard should be a critically important part of the story you are trying to tell. In a culture that writes right to left you might put higher-value content on the right-hand side of the visualisation. \n\nIn terms of in terms interpretation you want to key into things that people are naturally good at interpreting. For example, if you are presenting sales by product category and you have 10 product categories you could choose to leverage a bar chart where the length of the bar represents sales or a pie chart where the angle of the slice represents sales. A bar chart would be a better choice because people find it easy to compare the length of a bar. We cannot distinguish between the sizes of a slice with anywhere near the same level of accuracy.

Elden Ring was a video game released for multiple platforms in circa 2022 to critical acclaim. \n\nIf MH4U and Elden Ring were considered to be siblings nine years apart in a small family, how might the experiences of MH4U have influenced the growth and development of Elden Ring?", "context": "", "response": "Young parents face many challenges. Finances, education, and home expenses often compete with the needs of a growing family. Within the context provided, MH4U reflects the first child of a young couple who must make several investments, including clothing, baby essentials, and furniture.  This may be conveyed under the limited system resources available to MH4U under the 3DS console: 128MB of RAM. Additionally, one or both parents may work full time, leaving limited time to work with and grow the child. As the child, MH4U,  enters age 9, they should be entering 4th or 5th grade and have developed the cognitive and functional skills to support their parents. Additionally, the parents will have likely developed further in their careers and caretaking abilities that ensure the stability and growth of a small family. In this example, Elden Ring represents the second child, which arrives nine years after MH4U. In this context, as a result of the growth of experience and income of the family, and assuming the family equates to a Playstation 4, the family now enjoys 8GB of RAM.\n\nAs described in the preceding paragraph, the familial environment that Elden Ring emerges from is vastly different than that of MH4U. However, there are additional benefits beyond the system limitations provided. These benefits are conveyed through the emotional and physical support provided through familial bonds, in this case, that of an older and younger sibling. Upon the arrival of Elden Ring, MH4U is eager to help their parents with caretaking tasks which may include keeping the child company, completing small jobs and errands, and establishing familial bonds with their sibling. The parents will be able to draw upon the experience of raising MH4U and apply those lessons to their newest member of the family. It\u2019s important that the parents continue to create small jobs for MH4U that help to convey positive responses to younger family members: caretaking, guidance, and companionship. \n\nAs MH4U graduates from their teens and enters early adulthood, it\u2019s critical that they stay actively involved in the life of their sibling. By age 18, MH4U will now be nine years older than Elden Ring, which as it happens, is the same age when MH4U became an older sibling. Under this lens, MH4U carries greater social responsibility than they did when they were the same age as Elden Ring. MH4U may also begin to contemplate leaving the family for continuing education. While it\u2019s common for individuals to depart the family for secondary education after age 18, it\u2019s critically important that MH4U continue to maintain constant contact with its younger sibling to provide guidance and advice and convey lessons learned from its formative experiences.  \n\nIn this way, Elden Ring has a fast track to develop. MH4U is able to provide guidance equatable to best practices, experiences, and trial and error. Additionally, MH4U development during constrained resources encourages Elden Ring to do \u201cmore with less\u201d and ensures a fastidious approach towards the allocation of resources. By the time Elden Ring approaches age 18, they enjoy the combined experiences of their parents and their older sibling which helps to increase their likelihood of success and families are stronger when they provide guidance and stability to their children.\n\nIn summary, the success of Elden Ring was no accident. The investments of the parents into the older sibling, MH4U, however lacking, provided a baseline level by which MH4U could invest in its younger sibling Elden Ring. Through this chain of investments, the family finds a greater chance of success. Under the lens of the original context, there would not be a critically reception to Elden Ring had not the parents made baseline investment and support to MH4U during the formative years of the family.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Which ski pass, between IKON pass and Epic pass, should I buy if I live in the Bay area and mostly go to the Lake Tahoe area for skiing.", "context": "", "response": "Although both passes provide great value when you visit the snow resorts more than 7 days each snow season, they have some differences that you need to consider before you make the purchase.\nFor IKON pass, you can access 14 ski resorts for unlimited time and over 40 ski resorts for max 7 days each snow season.

The relative amount of change, expansion, or shrinkage differs for each of the three main grain directions.  Those directions are longitudinal, radial, and tangential.  Longitudinal is the direction a tree or its branches grows length-wise.  In most lumber, this is its length.  The change in this direction is very small.  That is why a wooden ruler can be used without changing its measurements when ambient moisture changes.  In almost all uses, longitudinal expansion and contraction are small enough not to be of concern.  Radial and tangential directional expansion and contraction are significant and different enough that they affect the dimensional stability of a piece of wood.  The relative amount of change in each direction is specific to the wood species.  Regardless of wood species, the change is greater in the tangential direction than in the radial direction.  The tangential direction is tangential to the growth rings in the wood, and the radial direction is perpendicular to the growth rings.  The T/R or ratio of tangential to radial change correlates to the dimensional stability of a wood species.  If you visualize a piece of lumber that is milled square and comes from a part of a log such that the rings are almost straight across in one direction, that is referred to as vertical grain or quarter sawn.  As the moisture content of the wood changes to come into equilibrium with its environment, it will move toward a diamond shape.  The closer the T/R ratio is to 1, the less the square dimension will distort. Dimensional stability and the direction of wood movement is important to plan for when cutting joinery in wood.  If two joined pieces are aligned so that they will not move in the same direction relative to the joint, the joint will be unstable when the ambient humidity changes and can cause the joint to fail.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "How does Walter White die in Breaking bad", "context": "", "response": "In the final episode of Breaking Bad, Walter attempts to clean-up his mess by killing off all those who betrayed him, and rescue Jesse from his captors.

Belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation and race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy. Since the end of World War II in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist; the term is more often used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions of neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes employed to describe contemporary parties with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th-century fascist movements. \n\nThe first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries, most notably Germany. Fascism also had adherents outside of Europe. Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is inherently bad and views imperialism, political violence and war as means to national rejuvenation.

Pets are often treated like another member of the family and while they can require a lot of work, they can also bring a lot of joy and laughter into your life.\n\nHere are a few options for pets and some advantages and disadvantages for each:\n\n1. Dogs - Dogs can be amazing pets. They are typically very loyal, friendly, and beloved by families all over the world. Dogs can be taught to do tricks like sit, stay, and fetch. There are also over 300 different breeds of dog and they come in all kinds of sizes, ranging from a few lbs (1-2 kg) to over 150 lbs (70 kg). Dogs require quite a bit of work to train and can be very expensive to own due to high veterinary bills. Some dogs can be aggressive, and this is an important factor to consider given that you have two young children. Dogs also typically require access to a yard or regular walking to ensure that they are not going to the bathroom inside. Also, many people are allergic to dogs due to the fact that most dogs shed. If your family members are prone to allergies and are still looking to add a dog to the family, perhaps you should consider a hypoallergenic breed like a Yorkshire Terrier, poodle, or a poodle mix like a Golden Doodle. Dogs typically live between 7-15 years, depending on the breed. \n\n2. Cats - Cats are another very popular pet option for families. Like dogs, they come in many different breed options but there are far fewer breed options for cats than dogs. Most cats grow to be about 10 lbs (4 kg), but they can range in size from around 5 lbs (2 kg) to 25 lbs (11 kg). Indoor cats typically live between 12-18 years. Cats typically require far less work and are generally more independent than dogs. While most cats can't be trained to do tricks, cats are often lower maintenance than dogs. Cats can often be left alone at the house for a long time. Most cats use a litter box to relieve themselves so they typically don't need regular walks or access to a yard. Like dogs, most cats shed, so allergies and cleaning pet dander can be a nuisance. Cats typically eat less than dogs and often are less expensive to own.\n\n3. Fish - Fish are a popular pet option for families that are looking for a very low maintenance pet that only requires feeding a couple of times per day. Fish typically require water, a clean fish tank and fish food, and that's about it. Some pet fish, like goldfish, can be bought for as little as $10, while exotic fish can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Most pet fish will live up to 2 years if properly cared for, but certain species can live up to 30 years. \n\n4. Reptiles - Reptiles like snakes, lizards, or iguanas can also be pets. They typically require low maintenance and can live for up to 20-30 years. They require a cage, regular feeding, and are generally easy to take care of. For medical emergencies, they may require specialized veterinarians or doctor's, which can be hard to find.\n\n5. Rodents - rodents like gerbils, hamsters and even mice can be pets as well. They require regular feeding and a small cage, and are typically very easy to take care of. People often include a running wheel in the cage for these small animals so that they can exercise. However, they don't live very long; most rodents only live for a couple of years at most. \n\nIn addition to the list above, there are many other options for pets such as guinea pigs, rabbits, pigs and even exotic options like monkeys. Depending on where you live, there may be certain restrictions on the types of pets that you can own.

There are several ways of charging these batteries. The most common is a plug that provides either 30A or 50A of power, depending on the RV size. Most RVs also have generators, but generators are noisy and require either gas or diesel to run. Some RVs with lithium batteries (or more rarely, lead acid), have a second alternator installed that charges the batteries while driving. Finally, solar power is a popular option.

It probably ends up in a landfill, where it will decompose for over 1000 years as it deposits toxic chemicals. Plastic is an invention that has done more harm than good. There are about 363,762,732,605 pounds of plastic covering the earth. Most of this plastic can\u2019t be recycled. Although people think it is too expensive or inconvenient to get rid of plastics, we should reduce the amount of plastic used or increase the price of plastics.\u00a0One reason is that when plastic invades a balanced ecosystem, it corrupts it completely. The marine biome is one that is affected by this product. The animals in the ocean die of suffocation, ingestion of plastics, and entanglement. The animals affected are seagulls, whales, seals, fish, and turtles, and that's just a few. The animals eat so much plastic that they die of constipation from it.\u00a0Another reason is the presence of microplastics in food and people. About 99% of fish have microplastics in their stomachs, livers, and filets (the meat of fish). Approximately 80% of cows have microplastics in their meat and milk. A good point is that mealworms and waxworms are studied to digest plastics, and they should be added to landfills to break down plastics. There are about 50,000 particles of plastic in an adult person, and this number is rising fast.\u00a0Third, most plastic is littered. There are about 10 million tons of plastic litter every year. Every week, you ingest about a credit card's worth of plastic. There are about 44 million pounds of plastic that are produced that is very deadly to the environment.\"The plastic in the environment is in your water, food, and body. These plastics should not be there; they can lead to cancer, according to a recent study. We need to stop using plastic in our lives.\u00a0Some ways we can reduce the amount of plastic on earth are by using sustainable materials such as wood, plant fibers, and mushroom styrofoam. We can also try to buy recyclable plastics that have a triangle formed by three cycling arrows. Use a tote bag instead of a plastic one, or a metal and glass straw instead of a plastic one.

By avoiding such circumstances/conditions, we can be content and maybe that's what need in life: not strive to be happy all the time but avoid what we truly don't like so that happiness takes care of its own.\n\nAnswer 2: Yes! Life is too short to get caught in dull moments so a human needs to optimize for maximum happiness. The definition of happiness differs and that's ok; we all live once and we should spend our time looking for new things that make us happier.\n\nAnswer 3: No. Most meaningful lessons in life are learned in situations when we're not particularly happy: Loss of a close person, financial break downs, unexpected health conditions.

Some of them deliver food, and some might be working at a cafe or a restaurant. They are all around us, helping people to do many things. Sometimes, they can do what humans can\u2019t do, and they can also sometimes perform better than humans. Nowadays, many scientists and engineers are arguing if artificial intelligence could dramatically make our lives better, or would it spell the end of the human race?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robots and Artificial Intelligence(A.I. for short) are developing systematically but dramatically, so someday, they might feel and think like humans. For example, some robots can \u201cfeel\u201d pain by detecting how strong the force is to technically \u201cfeel\u201d the pain. Furthermore, robots can think like humans by programming them to think how humans do. However, robots have less flexible thinking, since they are only doing what others programmed them to do, especially robots like Industrial robots that are less complex.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, because A.I. is developing at a great speed, it might eventually become a threat to the human race. Many people such as Steven Hawkings warned that as A.I. develops further, they might be unstoppable, and might become one of the most dangerous enemies. Furthermore, according to the UN, A.I. might have stereotypical thoughts about certain races because of people\u2019s discriminative behavior, and it can further have an impact on judgment between many kinds of people. Primarily, robots and A.I. can be a threat to the human race, so we need to take care of its program and rule it better so that it can be a good tool that can improve our lives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, I think that although now, A.I. still has some difficulties in doing certain things, A.I. can solve some of our problems, and make our lives better, and easier. A.I. can solve many problems, and they can even do some work better than humans. For example, robots can go to dangerous places like space, deep sea, and poisonous areas. Furthermore, robots can do dangerous jobs like welding which is dangerous work that needs to be done precisely. Robots are used in places like this because Industrial robots can do work precisely, and they can even save the worker\u2019s life. For another example, a remote robot called Canadarm2 that works in the International Space Station can help astronauts by doing work in space to help the other astronauts that make their life easier.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In conclusion, A.I. is starting to become part of our lives since it\u2019s starting to think and feel like humans with a great speed, and although it might become a threat to human races, I still think A.I. can solve many problems by doing what we have trouble doing. Once, Nick Boston claimed that \u201cMachine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to invent\u201d which means that humans only need to make A.I. because it can do things that other materials can, and it can also create and build itself.

The problem with this method is that Trump was then able to revoke those acts, undoing all the work that Obama accomplished.  The second is bi-partisan support for Presidential programs.  If both sides take ownership of an issue, it tends to make it easier to enact policy.  Third, the President needs to be able to compromise.

The primary mistake people make when cold calling is in defining what success looks like.  For most sales roles, the goal of a cold call is to establish rapport, not to book an order.  Think about it - when was the last time you purchased something by phone the first time you were contacted?  Odds are that several follow ups were required before you were ready to buy, no matter how qualified a buyer you appeared to be.  \n\nEstablishing rapport means getting your prospect to open up, because he/she has determined that you are worth the time to do so.  So the keys to establishing rapport are simple:  be courteous and respectful, provide appropriate context, and be OPEN.   Let's consider each of these individually.  First, courtesy and respect- after briefly introducing yourself, ask the prospect if now is a good time to talk for a few minutes?  We've all experienced the annoyance of a caller who dives right into the conversation immediately after hearing a \"hello\".  Be respectful of your prospect's schedule and give him/her an \"out.\"  If it's not a good time, you're not going to have a successful call no matter what you try.  \n\nNext, provide appropriate context.  Don't assume he/she knows nothing about what you are trying to sell. If that were the case, this prospect wouldn't be a very good target for you! Prepare a short introductory statement that can be delivered in a genuine way with a friendly tone.  For example, \"I'm with ACME Mobile Window Repair and wanted to share some spring promotions with you - have you seen our trucks around your neighborhood?\"  Setting context will help build rapport by providing a clear understanding of why you are calling, and what you hope to get out of the conversation.  Successful sales people are very comfortable with the fact that they are trying to sell something.  Own it, but do so in a low key and friendly way, and this will help lower the defenses of your prospect if he/she sounds guarded\n\nLastly, be open.  This means open to going off script, open to hearing about competition or open to negative impressions of what you're selling.  An open dialogue allows room for questions, both from you and from your prospect.     Think about an enjoyable conversation you've had lately.  Was it a natural back and forth, with questions posed and answers provided?  Did the questions take the conversation into a deeper dialogue?  A successful cold call is one that feels like a natural conversation about a topic of shared interest. If your prospect goes off on a tangent, don't redirect too soon, or better yet - ask a question - \"I'm curious - What made you think of carpets when I mentioned windows?\"  If he/she goes negative about your offering, ask another question  - \"What in your experience has caused you to feel this way?\"  \n\nCold calling is a skill that can improve with practice.  The more comfortable you are being courteous, setting context, and remaining open, the better your sales outcomes will be.

The songwriting team of Rogers & Hammerstein was the first to use songs to further the plot vs. break the plot for a song and dance. Their musicals are still enormously popular and performed constantly. They include \"Oklahoma\", \"The King & I\", and \"The Sound of Music\". Leonard Bernstein, while most known for classical music made a major contribution to musicals with the groundbreaking \"West Side Story\", an updated Romeo and Juliet story with spectacular music, every song a classic. Bernstein collaborated with Stephen Sondheim on this musical. Sondheim ushered in the modern-day musical in which shows might explore a theme vs. a linear plot. While he is often criticized for not having \"hummable\" melodies, his genius is undeniable, and he did have one bonafide hit with \"Send in the Clowns\". Jules Styne composed what is often considered the greatest musical of all time, \"Gypsy\". The dynamite songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Ebb composed the longest-running American musical, \"Chicago\" and the dark yet entertaining \"Cabaret\".

They may protect water supplies, yield wood, harbor wildlife,and provide space to recreate.We are concerned about the level of harvest, the adjacent land use, pollution from nearby industries, or where forests burn. Informed management requires knowledge of all these related factors and, perhaps above all, the spatial arrangement of these factors. Buffer strips near rivers may protect water supplies,clearings may prevent the spread of fire, and polluters upwind may harm our forests. A GIS helps us analyze these spatial interactions, and is also particularly useful at displaying spatial data and analysis. A GIS is often the only way to solve spatially-related problems.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Which bears are the best bears?", "context": "", "response": "It really depends what you mean by \"best.\"  If you prefer smaller, less aggressive bears then black bears are best.

There are though, some challenges, that can reduce the speed of adoption. The following are some of the concerns associated with electric vehicles:\n    \n1. Higher upfront cost: Electric cars are generally more expensive to acquire than gasoline-powered cars, although this gap is narrowing. But, electric vehicles are typically cheaper to run and maintain. At this stage, they have achieved parity for the total cost of ownership.\n2. Increased charging times: New electric cars can get to 80% of their range in less than half an hour when using fast charging stations, but that still slower than their combustion engine counterparts and many charging stations have lower speeds.\n3. Limited charging infrastructure: Despite the expansion of electric vehicle charging facilities, their availability remains less extensive than that of gas stations. Consequently, careful trip planning may be necessary to guarantee access to charging stations when required.\n4. Less range: New electric cars typically have a range of around 230-320 miles, which is still less than most of the combustion engine vehicles.\n5. Reduced number of options: Given the relatively new interest from car manufacturers, fewer alternatives are available for individual use cases.

The game of lacrosse is based on the traditional Native American game \"baggataway.\"'  This means \"little brother of war;\" it was also commonly referred to as \"The Creator's Game.\"  There are currently three predominant versions of lacrosse: Field Lacrosse, Box Lacrosse, and Women's Lacrosse.  \nField lacrosse is the men's outdoor version of the game.  There are 10 players on each team, on the field at once.  These players consist of 3 attackmen, 3 midfielders, 3 defensemen, and one goalie.  Each player has a helmet, shoulder pads, gloves, elbow pads, and a lacrosse stick.  6 players carry a short stick, which measures between 40 to 42 inches, and a maximum of four players on the field at a time can carry a long stick, which is between 52 and 72 inches long.  Short sticks are generally used by offensive players, and long sticks by defensive only players.  The goalie has a specific stick to his position, with a. wider \"head\" to assist in making saves.  The ball for play is made of solid rubber, about the size of a baseball.  A lacrosse goal measures 6 feet by 6 feet.  Teams are awarded one point for getting the ball into the goal.  \nEach game is 60 minutes long, made up of four 15 minute periods.  At the start of each period, and after ever goal, there is a face-off at the center of the field.  A unique aspect of lacrosse is that on a shot, when the ball goes out of bounds, possession is awarded to the team closet to the ball when it went out.  On out of bounds other than a shot attempt, possession is awarded to the opposite team that touched it last.  During the course of play teams may substitute players \"on the fly,\" through a designated substitution area (commonly referred to as \"the box\"), which is in between the benches of both teams.\nPenalties in lacrosse result from rule violations, deemed by either an infraction (commonly referred to as a \"technical foul\"), or a personal foul.  The result of the offending team is either losing possession of the ball, or temporarily losing a player for a designated period of time (similar to hockey).  The offending player serves their penalty in the box.  The team that has taken the penalty is the playing \"man-down\" for the time serving portion of the rule violation, while the other team is player \"man-up.\"\nThe generally consensus for who the greatest lacrosse player of all time is usually between three players: Jim Brown, Gary Gait, and John Grant.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Do spotted hyenas actually laugh?", "context": "", "response": "Spotted hyenas have two major vocalizations: a whoop and a cackle.

It was later the the subject of a number of public talks by astronaut Mike Mullane.  The theory is essentially that when we accept deviations from an expected standard, the deviation becomes the standard.  In the Challenger disaster, engineers kept noticing rubber o-rings that came back from tests in an out of tolerance state.  Because there were no dramatic failures during the tests, the engineers adjusted the standard for the o-rings to absorb these abnormalities.  Unfortunately, by normalizing deviance from the expected standard, it led to an o-ring failing during the Challenger launch, and the Challenger shuttle disintegrated in flight.  The normalization of deviance is an important pitfall to avoid when running any organization, but especially those which put its members in high risk situations, such as space travel.

He was the founder of Ford Motor Company, and chief developer of the assembly line technique of mass production. Ford created the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford, and his conversion of the automobile from an expensive luxury into an accessible conveyance profoundly impacted the landscape of the 20th century.\n\nFord was born on a farm in Michigan's Springwells Township to a Belgian family, leaving home at age 16 to work in Detroit. It was a few years before this time that Ford first experienced automobiles, and throughout the later half of the 1880s, Ford began repairing and later constructing engines, and through the 1890s worked with a division of Edison Electric. He officially founded Ford Motor Company in 1903, after prior failures in business but success in constructing automobiles.\n\nFord's 1908 introduction of the Model T automobile revolutionized both transportation and American industry. As the Ford Motor Company sole owner, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with \"Fordism\", the mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford was also among the pioneers of the five-day work week. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout North America and major cities on six continents.\n\nFord was widely known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I. In the 1920s Ford promoted antisemitic content through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent, and the book, The International Jew. After his son Edsel died in 1943, Ford resumed control of the company but was too frail to make decisions and quickly came under the control of subordinates. He turned over the company to his grandson Henry Ford II in 1945. He died in 1947 after leaving most of his wealth to the Ford Foundation, and control of the company to his family.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is Cuneiform?", "context": "", "response": "Cuneiform is a logo-syllabic script that was used to write several languages of the Ancient Middle East.

The difference is that ultimate frisbee is a team sport that combines several of the rules of football, basketball and soccer. Like football, a team takes possession of the frisbee and tries to move it down field and into an end zone. Like basketball, once you are in possession of the frisbee, you cannot move your pivot foot. However, there is no \"dribbling\" with a frisbee so if a player has possession of the frisbee outside of their end zone, they have to pass it before they can move their pivot foot. Ultimate frisbee is played on a soccer field and the player movement looks most like that sport. Frisbee golf, on the other hand, follows the rules of golf, except that the player throws a frisbee to the hole instead of hitting a ball with clubs. Some people play the sport on dedicated frisbee golf courses, using a set of specialized discs of various weights and carrying them in a bag from hole to hole like a golfer would do with their set of clubs. Others simply take a standard 175-gram frisbee and make up a course as they go.

Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.

Unlike a sales tax imposed at the point of sale, a consumption tax could be structured to be progressive rather than regressive, by using a year end tax return to calculate 'net consumption' during a given tax year, with the return summing all sales of qualified investments and then subtracting all purchases of new qualified investments. The tax return then apply a progressive tax rate to the total net investment. Much of the complexity of the current tax code would be eliminated. There would no longer be a need for complex calculations relating to capital gains, based on the concept of 'tax basis' and other arcane notions. Complexities relating to tax beneficial retirement-related savings accounts would also become unnecessary. Investors would no longer be penalized for efficiency-driven portfolio rebalancing. Billionaires would not be taxed significantly if they live frugally, but they could be taxed at very high rates for substantial consumption. A billionaire who buys large yachts, multiple mega-mansions, etc. would pay high taxes. A billionaire who lives modestly would not. But the latter billionaire is keeping her money invested in the economy, providing resources that will further economic growth. Opponents of a consumption tax cite the fact that most consumption taxes are thought to be regressive. However, as perviously mentioned, the consumption tax could be structured to be progressive, and in fact could be structured to be even more progressive than the current income tax. The progressive rates could be based on wealth rather than the amount of annual consumption or income. It would even be possible to tax consumption at over 100% in the case of billionaires. For example, if someone had a net worth of over $10 billion, we could tax that person's consumption at 150%. Regressiveness concerns can also be addressed by exempting a large portion of consumption. Annual consumption under a certain level, say $30,000 per year, could be tax free, or taxed at a low sales-tax-like rate of, say, 5%.

For example, a bishop can only move diagonally on squares of its same color, whereas rooks can only move vertically or horizontally. The goal of the game is to use your pieces in a strategic manner that ultimately leads to your opponent's King being captured. The most common way to achieve this is by using your pieces to capture your opponent's pieces that are defending the King, and then exploiting this weakness to attack the King.

It can also help to track patterns and help predict natural disasters, glacier changes and soil erosion.\n\nAll of the environmental data gathered is essential in helping with conservation, protection and restoration efforts. Other industries can also access and utilise the data collected by researchers and conservationists.\nUtility Companies\n\nOne of the most active users of GIS is the utility sector, and they use it to help with: \n\n    Managing grids and identifying patterns in customer usage, outages and supply issues\n    Tracking and monitoring pipelines\n    Locating water pipes and cables\n    Wireless networks\n    Construction planning\n    Monitor assets and field workers\n\nGIS, with its comprehensive database, helps to maintain and monitor overhead and underground utilities, improving efficiency and effectiveness and saving time and money\nInfrastructure Companies\n\nThe planning and development of our roads, electricity, water supply lines, buildings, and society\u2019s basic framework is mapped, managed, and monitored by companies that incorporate GIS in the infrastructure industry.\n\nGIS simplifies communications, improves efficiency and effectiveness for field workers, helps to monitor assets and workers, tracks and stores customer usage and issues, improves customer/client satisfaction, and much more.\nTelecommunications\n\nGIS is widely used in the telecom sector to help monitor real-time data about current use, outages, and signal strength to help them better understand customers\u2019 patterns and needs. \n\nThe telecom companies also use GIS to help optimise their resources effectively and efficiently, mitigate problems and plan for future growth.\nRetail\n\nRetail stores depend on knowing where their customer base lives or works and how far they are willing to travel to buy goods. GIS supplies essential data to help retail companies determine location, optimise inventory and sales, and plan their marketing campaigns to reach their ideal clientele.\nGovernment\n\nGeographical information is critical for the government to make decisions based on real-time data.  Government operations are spatial, whether for emergency response and management, fires, accidents, utilities, infrastructure, etc.\nAgriculture\n\nFood is a basic need for humans and animals. The agricultural industry uses GIS to help identify usable fertile land vs non-fertile land, weather hazards such as flooding or drought, and water supply.\nDevelopment and Urban Planning\n\nPlanners and developers rely on GIS to help them factor in several components when looking to build and develop an area. For example, they use GIS to find empty lots and determine resource and infrastructure availability and needs.\n\nGIS helps plan roads, housing, schools, businesses, government spaces, and hospitals. It also stores historical data, including ageing infrastructure, monuments, wetland areas, protected habitats, and species.\n\nAnother important factor is soil mapping, identifying possible hazards such as flooding, volcanic activity or other environmental issues.\nHealthcare\n\nToday, healthcare sectors use GIS to track disease patterns, whether an outbreak, an epidemic, cancer hotspots, or people in a specific location suffering from an environmentally caused illness. \n\nGIS has a disease surveillance system that can conduct a spatial analysis to locate which area is high-risk, and the GIS software is better are validating data.\nInsurance Companies\n\nMitigating and understanding risks ahead of time is essential to insurance companies, and they use GIS to ensure they are aware of possible dangers before giving you a quote.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What are some vacation ideas this summer?", "context": "", "response": "Summer is a great time to go on vacation especially to enjoy the outdoor.

The British threat to take away guns was more than a political imposition limiting resistance to British rule, it was potentially a life-threatening policy to families who depended on obtaining food via hunting. This background is in part why Americans originally had such a strong reaction to normalizing gun controls and access, which was codified as a right to bear arms in our Constitution. However, by contrast this aspect of the rationale against gun control largely does not exist today. Gun usage is for sport, and for protection, and only minimally to provide food on the table.

Once clean, you'll want to bring a large pot (typically 80+ quarts in size) of water to a rolling boil.  Add in spices to flavor the water.  There are also pre-made bags of spice known as 'boil.'  Boil the crawfish until they float to the top and turn bright red.  Then allow the crawfish to soak to absorb the added spice.  This process can last as long as an hour or more, though 30 minutes is fairly typical.  Many people will add potatoes, corn, onions, and other sides to their boil.  Learning to peel a crawfish is an art, but can be quickly done by twisting off the tail.  Peel the rest of the shell off and eat the tail.

The first was legalism, which used the courts to attack discriminatory laws or practices.  The limits of legalism are the cost, slow change, burden on the individual and it was elite driven.  The second was nonviolent direct action (NVDA).  NVDA identifies an unjust law which is then broken by individuals trying to promote change.  Individuals must then accept the consequences of breaking the law, but if enough do so, it puts pressure on local governments.  The third strategy was political action, which used voting on proactive agendas to force change.  Finally, the fourth strategy was the black power movement.  This strategy promoted disengagement from white-society and setting up a separate black power structure.  It provided services to the black community and promoted positive black images, but had weak leadership and was prone to violence and paranoia.\nIf I was advising a civil rights group today, I would advise them to use the first three strategies.  Legalism, NVDA and political action are positive and effective ways to enable change.  They usually encourage sympathetic news coverage and get the message of the group out to the broader public.  A strategy like the black power movement would not be effective.  If you want to change society, you can\u2019t separate from it or try to change it from the outside.

Humans that best align with this organizing force or God are guaranteed good fortune in this life or after.  There are variations in humans level of involvement in this process with Christianity requiring a savior (Jesus) for people to enter the afterlife vs achieving a higher state of consciousness in this life or through reincarnation.\n\nPhilosophers differ on the meaning of life with predominate views following down the lines of seeking your own fulfillment or the fulfillment of others.

Royal Navy submarines operating off the coast of Argentina could use electronic sensors in their periscopes to detect electronic signals from Argentine aircraft as they took off. These subs provided the fleet with enough advanced warning to launch Sea Harriers on interception missions.

Some 21st century mathematicians and physicists believe Tau is a better choice than Pi for use in science and mathematics.\n\nLike Pi, Tau is an irrational and transcendental number.  In decimal form, the value of Tau is 6.283185\u2026\n\nPart of the motivation for Tau is the observation that the number 2*Pi or 2\u03c0 occurs with surprising frequency throughout science and mathematics.  This raises the question of whether Pi is really an important number or something equal to two times Pi is actually more important.  Perhaps the implication is that Pi is exactly one half of some very important number!\n\nFurther consideration of the question leads to several compelling observations:\n\n\t- Using C/r as the key circle constant is better aligned with the way we define a circle: the set of all points a fixed distance (r) form a give point.\n\t- Radian angle measurements of fraction of a circle make much more sense when Tau is used as the base constant.  Using Pi, on quarter of a circle is Pi is Pi/2, one half is Pi, and the angle of a a full circle is 2*Pi.  With Tau, the angle measures are intuitively aligned to the fraction of a circle: a quarter circle is Tau/4, a half circle is Tau/2 and the angle of a full circle is Tau.  \n\t- Similarly, the radian zeroes, max, and min of the sin and cosine functions align to fractions of Tau in an intuitive fashion that aids, rather than confuses, understanding.\n\t- Key formulas that traditionally use Pi actually show more clear mathematical meaning when expressed using Tau.  For example, the area of a circle itself, when expressed with Tau, shows the same pattern of quadratic forms in distance fallen, spring energy, and kinetic energy.\n\t- Similarly, the tau-based formula for circular area actually confirms to the original proof by Archimedes showing that area of a circle equals the area of a triangle with base C (circumference) and height r (radius):  A = 1/2 b*h = 1/2 C*r = 1/2 (Tau*r)*r = 1/2 Tau*r^2.\n\n\nTau has seen significant adoption since it was originally proposed.  \n\nThe relationship between Tau and Pi is very simple.
