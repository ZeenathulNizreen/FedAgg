Water, yeast, flour and salt. For best results you should use typo \"00\" flour. When using such finely grained flour go for a 65% hydration dough, 3% salt, and 0.5% dry yeast. This means for every 1000 parts flour, put 650 parts water.\n\nGreat pizza dough takes time to ferment. There are few ways to do it but the easiest one for the home is to pre-ferment a small portion of equal amounts of water and flour.\n\nFor example, start with separating out the total ingredients: 1000g flour, 650g water, 30g salt, 5g dry yeast. This will result in 1680g of dough enough for ~8 medium pizzas. Mix 200g of water, flour and the yeast and let it sit on counter for an hour. Then move to the refrigerator for slow fermentation for ~24h. Take this out and add the remaining ingredients. Kneed until smooth, and let it rest on the counter for 1h. Cover with olive oil to avoid drying out. Cut balls and place in a tray. Lightly cover with olive oil again and cling film.

A good home espresso machine provides the ability to make high quality espresso in a machine that is typically smaller and less expensive than their commercial counterparts. \n\nThere are three common espresso machine designs for home use: manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic. As the name implies -- manual machines require direct \"manual\" control by the user, who typically applies pressure through a lever to deliver the desired brew pressure. Semi-automatic machines require the user to prepare the coffee into the portafilter, but then rely on an automated pump and to deliver the desired brew pressure for espresso. Fully automatic machines automate the entire process end-to-end: grinding the beans, loading the ground beans into the portafilter, and then pumping water through the portafilter at predefined pressure levels to brew espresso. \n\nManual machines typically have a lower cost, smaller footprint, and provide the user with more direct control over the brewing process. This allows skilled users to make higher-quality espresso than they would with a more automated machine. In contrast, fully automatic machines are often the easiest to use, but are unable to make espresso as consistently great as a skilled barista could with a manual machines. Fully automatic machines are inherently more complex, more expensive to purchase, and more likely to have longer-term reliability issues. \n\nRegardless of the type of espresso machine, two factors influence how well they will perform: their ability to manage brew temperature and brew pressure.

But historians have generally narrowed it down to the following major causes:\n\nRise of ethnic nationalism in Soviet Republics:  After decades of suppressing national identities, ethnic groups began asserting their nationality and demanded greater autonomy and political power.  This resulted in numerous riots and protests throughout the Soviet Union with demands for independence and national self-determination. \n\nEconomic stagnation and fall of oil prices:  The centrally planned economic model resulted in massive shortages of staple consumer products.  Shops were continually empty and Soviet citizens needed to wait in long lines to purchase basic goods.  After years of economic deprivation, Soviet citizens were deeply angry at their government. In addition, oil prices declined significantly in the late 1980s, which provided the Soviet government a key source of hard currency.  This it made it difficult for the Soviet government to sustain high levels of military spending and keep the economy functioning. \n\nPerestroika and Glasnost: Gorbachev's reforms of the 1980s were intended to reinvigorate the Soviet economy.  However, they unintentionally triggered an opening of debate throughout the country.  The increased freedoms allowed people to more openly criticize the government and demand changes.  \n\nAfghanistan and Chernobyl: In the late 1980s, two events symbolized the incompetence of the Soviet government.

The three biggest concerns revolve around:\n\n1. A short growing season\n2. Cooler summers\n3. Wetter than average summers\n\nHere are some solutions you can use to mitigate these challenges.\n\nDo deal with the short growing season, you need to get a headstart on growing by using starters. What this means is that instead of planting a seed in the ground in Springtime, you start a seed indoors in late winter, grow it into a small to medium plant, then transplant that \"starter\", into the ground when the temperature is warm enough. You can buy starters from Nurseries, or start your own at home. Nursery starters are easier, but by growing at home you can experiment with more rare varieties and gain experience in cultivating a plant from the seedling stage. If you grow your own it's important to slowly climatize the plant to outdoor weather leading up to the transplant date by moving it outside starting with a couple hours a day, increasing an hour or two per day over 2-3 weeks. By using starters you essentially extend the growing season by giving your plant a multi month head start. \n\nTomatoes mature best in warm to hot climates. The pacific northwest has cooler summers than many of the growing regions in the world. There is not a lot we can do to control mother nature, but there are one or two methods to help yourself here. Certain varieties of tomatoes do better in cooler summers - try and select these. If you're using starts from a local nursery they can guide you - starts from big national box stores might not be the best for your local Northwest climate. Another technique, if you are experiencing a cooler than normal Spring and start of Summer, is to build a \"hoop house\", using PVC pipe frame and a visqueen tarp. This will let light in and act as a mini-greenhouse, trapping heat around the plant. Keep in mind tomatoes need pollinators like bees to produce fruit, so once the plan t begins to flower you'll want to ensure pollination can occur.\n\nMoisture creates issues with Tomato plants as they are very susceptible to various types of fungus that grow on the leaves. Blight is one in particular common among tomatoes. The wet summers we sometimes have create conditions on the leaves conducive to fungal growth, they can also splash fungus onto the leaves from the soil. The easiest way to deal with these two issues is in proper pruning. As early as you can prune any lower sets of leaves that could possibly come into contact with the ground. Don't do this too soon as the plant needs some leaves to grow. There are many ways to prune a tomato that you can read about, but one common one in wet areas is called single stemming - in this technique you prune \"suckers\", which are the small offshoots that grow in between the main stem and the leaf stems. By pruning the suckers you prevent too much bushy growth, which will help the leaves dry out with airflow after a rain storm. The last issue related to water is that heavy late season rains will cause the fruits to swell with water and crack. There's not an easy solution here. If it's towards the end of the season and a rainstorm is coming in, this can be a good time to pick all your fruit, your green tomatoes can be used for green salsas. Some will resort to building a tarp structure above the plants to stop the rain, though this can require a bit more work and ingenuity, and you'll need another system to keep the plants watered.\n\nOverall, growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is totally possible and very rewarding.

BJJ can be practiced in two modalities: Sport BJJ and the other as self defense. Sport BJJ is competitive and based on a point system based on a competitor being awarded a number of points based on advancing to a more advantageous position. Alternatively, a competitor may immediately win the match by submission. When BJJ is used in self defense, the goal is usually to subdue an attacker.  Since BJJ is mostly grappling from the ground, it can be a highly effective practice for self defense as many street fights end up on the ground. While many of the techniques are intended to immobilize an opponent, it can be less effective if the opponent has an unfair advantage such as the use of a weapon. Practicing BJJ routinely will prepare the practitioner mentally for physical combat which can be advantageous in a self defense scenario. Another reason BJJ can be viewed as good for self defense is that there are techniques that can work well for different body types that level the playing field for even smaller or weaker opponents. If both opponents are trained in BJJ, size and strength can become a larger factor.  Routine training can also lead to increased physical fitness as classes can be quite rigorous and physically demanding.

Rods connect the engines pistons to the journals of the crankshaft. The crankshaft is evenly balanced by  weights on the opposite side of each journal to ensure that at high revolutions per minute (RPM) the motor is stable. As the crankshaft rotates it pushes the rods up and down that are connected to pistons. At the front of the crankshaft is a gear, the gear is typically connected via a chain to the camshaft. If the crankshaft is the heart of the engine, a camshaft is the brain of the engine. The camshaft determines when to open and close valves that let in air and fuel into each cylinder and let out exhaust from the internal combustion. The camshaft is a shaft that runs the length of the engine and has lobes on it, small metal cylinders called lifters ride on these lobes and are connected to push rods, the push rods are connected to rockers which rock back and forth opening and closing valves in the cylinder heads. The valves are located in the cylinder heads that sit on top of the cylinders that the pistons are in. As the pistons rotate up, a valve (being driven by the camshaft) opens to bring fuel into the cylinder, when the valve closes a spark from a spark plug, ignites the fuel causing a mini explosion pushing the cylinder down, a second valve opens letting the exhaust from the mini explosion exit the engine. This in turn rotates the crankshaft, pushing another piston up where the process continues. An intake manifold is like the lungs of a motor, it breaths in air from the atmosphere and mixes it with just the right amount of fuel to create that mini explosion in the cylinder.  The timing of the air, fuel, spark delivery is critical if it is off just the smallest of margins the engine will not run at all.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "How can I support a loved one going through anxiety and depression?", "context": "", "response": "This is a great question.

But overtime, you start feeling the benefits. For some people it takes days, for some months. But just learn to sit in peace with yourself.\n2. Find a therapist you feel comfortable with: I went through 3-4 therapists and therapy styles till I found the right one. And I wouldn't want it any other way. I used to think therapy is useless, but now I swear by it.\n3. Set time aside in the day to stress: For example, I used to set aside 8 PM to stress. When I would feel anxious about something I could not control, I would just tell myself that I will think about it at 8 PM. It takes practice but it helps.\n4. Go outdoors or find a hobby group: As much as I love my bed and TV, just getting myself out there between people helped me so much. I would recommend it for everyone. Being in introvert, I used to hate being around new people. Now I just put myself out there and I know people almost everywhere I go for my hobbies.\n5. It's ok to take medication. If anxiety and depression are spoiling your quality of life, it's ok to speak to a psychiatrist and see if they can recommend any medication. It almost was taboo growing up for me, but now I see the benefits.\n6. Talk your partners / close friends and express your feelings. Take support from people around you.

For three reasons: safety, reliability, and expediency\n\nSafety - snowboarding can be a very dangerous sport. I'd been skiing and snowboarding for years. One winter I had a snowboarding accident and slid into a tree. Snowboarding requires larger turns with a bigger radius. I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. \n\nReliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. \n\nExpediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately. This makes mixed groups of skiers and snowboarders the trickiest.

In order to understand the phenomenon, let's first break down the relationship between pressure and temperature. Warmer air has a higher pressure than cooler air, it has to do with the energy of air molecules but that is a subject for another time. When you open the refrigerator door, warmer air from the surroundings, which would be at room temperature, rushes inside the refrigerator. This is because the air flows from the higher-pressure region (the room), into the lower-pressure region (inside the refrigerator). When you shut the door, the warm air that had moved inside is now actively being cooled down by the refrigerator. Remember what we said about cooler air? The pressure inside the refrigerator starts to drop. This means that warmer air at higher pressure outside the refrigerator is trying to get in and is pushing against the door, the next time you try to open the door, you need to apply an extra force to counteract that pressure that is acting on the door. So that begs the question, why is this more noticeable a short time after you shut the door versus coming back let's say, an hour later? Glad you asked! It is because the seal that keeps the warm air outside and cool air inside the refrigerator is not a perfect seal, it is not designed to be for good reason. Over time, since the seal allows the movement of air, the pressure equalizes. In the absence of that pressure differential, there is no force acting on the outside of the door forcing it shut. Fun fact, commercial refrigerators have seals designed to allow for a lot more movement of air compared to home refrigerators. Want to guess why? It is because content inside commercial refrigerators needs to be accessed a lot more frequently. If their seals were similar to home refrigerators, people would experience the extra force each time they want to get something!

Assume they hit a strong drive of 275 yards, and land in the fairway.  Now their expected score for the hole might be 3.8.  Since their expected score went from 4.0 to 3.8 as a result of the drive, they gained .2 strokes with the drive.\n\nIf you repeat this for every shot in a round of golf, you would gain a picture of strokes gained for the overall round.\n\nOne key to strokes gained is what an expected score is for each hole.  This was first calculated for tour pro players when shot by shot stats were available via the ShotLink system used in pro events.  With the advent of consumer-level shot tracking systems, it is now possible to generated expected scores for virtually all levels of golfers, and thus any golfer can track strokes gained for their round, as compared to any level of golfer.\n\nStrokes gained is typically further broken down into 4 categories : Off the tee, approach, around the green, and putting.\n\nThe insights available once strokes gained was available has allowed insights into what really allows golfer to separate themselves from their competition.

The CPU is also important in determining how fast programs can run, from surfing the web to building spreadsheets. The GPU is a processor that is made up of many smaller and more specialized cores. By working together, the cores deliver massive performance when a processing task can be divided up and processed across many cores.\n\nWhile CPUs and GPUs have a lot in common - Both are critical computing engines. Both are silicon-based microprocessors. And both handle data - they do have different architectures and are built for different purposes.\n\nThe CPU is suited to a wide variety of workloads, especially those for which latency or per-core performance are important. A powerful execution engine, the CPU focuses its smaller number of cores on individual tasks and on getting things done quickly. This makes it uniquely well equipped for jobs ranging from serial computing to running databases.\n\nGPUs began as specialized ASICs developed to accelerate specific 3D rendering tasks.

Before we get into those specific factors, let's take a quick look at the broader electric vehicle market to provide context for your choice of an electric vehicle.\n\nThe global vehicle market has made an intentional transition from combustion engine vehicles to electric powered vehicles. In that transition, here are some things to consider:\n1. This transition will continue to take place through 2030 - 2035.  This is the timeframe most of the traditional automotive original equipment manufacturers have declared that they will be 100% transitioned to electric vehicle production.  This is important because you can assume that the technology behind the electrification of automobiles will be evolving and improving over this time period.\n2. Tesla was the company that disrupted the automotive market by producing, marketing and servicing the first all-electric vehicles.  Today they have the lead in most vehicles sold in the all-electric vehicle category.  If your only criteria for choosing your electric vehicle is to choose a vehicle from the leader, you have your answer in Tesla.\n3. Fast followers to Tesla fall into two very broad categories that are important to consider in your choice of an electric vehicle:\n     1. Traditional automotive original equipment manufactures - These are the companies that have been in business of producing, marketing and servicing combustion engine vehicles. In this category, think of General Motors, Ford, Toyota, VW, BMW, Kia, Stellantis and the like.  These companies have expertise in large scale production, quality control, after sale servicing, warranty management, customer experience and have large R&D teams that have been studying vehicle electrification for many years.  In addition, they have a large dealership network to distribute and service their vehicles for your convenience.  \n     2. Startup companies - These are the companies that have recently entered the market, following Tesla's lead, in starting their own brand of all-electric vehicles.  In this category, think of Rivian, Canoo, Fisker, Arrival and Vinfast among others.  They lack the large scale production experience, facilities and employee mass of the traditional automotive manufacturers.  However, typically their strength is in being able to nimbly change, adapt, attract expertise from the automotive market and have incentives to attract customers.\n\nGiven the backdrop of the broader vehicle market, now here are some factors to consider:\n    1. Miles per charge - With is typically categorized as \"Range\". The median driving range of all-electric vehicles in 2021 is 234 miles per charge.  This factor  matters if you take long trips between convenient charges.  You also can inference that vehicles that have a range much under 234 miles per charge may not have high quality batteries.\n    2. Charging Stations - You never needed to consider this factor when buying a traditional vehicle, unless the vehicle was powered by some obscure fuel.  Now, this factor is very important to research.  You will want to consider the number of charging stations available in your area, the time per charge and options for home charging.\n    3. Maintenance and Warranty - if something does happen to your vehicle, how easy is it to find a certified center to get your repairs quickly and conveniently accomplished.\n    4. All the same factors if you were buying a traditional automotive - Price, Size, Style and incentives available for the purchase.\n\nIf you keep these factors in mind, you should have a good experience in choosing your all-electric vehicle.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Why do cloud providers use dedicated hardware for network and storage processing but not large enterprises for their private cloud?", "context": "", "response": "Large cloud providers use dedicated hardware called data processing unit (DPU) to support multi-tenancy and isolation in hardware vs. hypervisor, improve performance through offload, own and control the entire infrastructure stack, free up cores to generate more revenue, and scale to support a large number of tenants and workloads.

Here is one potential path which you may consider: \n\n1) Improve you general fitness: In order to become a successful MMA athlete you need to have good general fitness. This can include things like strength training, yoga (flexibility) and cardio (swimming, running, etc). \n\n2) Get a breadth of experience: It is helpful to get competency in the various specialties that are found in MMA fights so you can adequately handle all styles that may be employed at the time.  At a high level, this can be split into two sections: \n    - Striking: Relevant marital arts you may want to consider training is Boxing, Kickboxing, Muai-Thai. \n    - Grappling: Relevant marital arts you may want to consider training in is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, Freestyle Wresting. \n\n3) Consider specializing: While it is good to have a breadth of different techniques, really honing in on one sub-discipline can give you an edge in comparison to other fighters.

This provides the plant with sufficient time to establish a new root structure before the winter.  Bearded iris grow from rhizomes, which quickly grow roots that provide the plant with the nutrients required to grow and form flowers.  The rhizomes should be removed from the soil using a garden fork making an attempt to keep as much root structure as possible.  The spiky leaves of the plant can be trimmed at this time to reduce the risk of the plant being disturbed by strong wind gusts when it is replanted.

Once the trainee can stop this will provide a measure of confidence and instill with the trainee that they are in control and will be able to stop at any time.  The basic stopping mechanism is something called a pizza-pie or wedge move.  The tips of the skis are positioned together (barely touching) with the back of the skis much further apart.  As far apart as the persons hips or even further.  The further apart the back of the skis are the slower the person will go to the point of stopping.   The trainer should both describe and demonstrate this position to the trainee.  The trainee will copy the position with feedback and adjustments from the trainer.

For this reason, there is a direct correlation between the \u201cvalue curve\u201d for both data and intelligent automation. \nThe value maturity curve for intelligent automation starts with basic, attended, or unattended automation that mimics basic human processes today.

What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent.

I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool?

The British Film Institute has had this rating of Citizen Kane for 50 years.  There are multitudes of reasons why this is a deserving title with a few examples below.\n\n1. Citizen Kane was a thinly veiled movie about a powerful person.  Even before the movie was released newspaper magnate William R Hearst became aware that Kane had many similarities to Hearst.  Both controlled media empires, ran for office, and had giant mansions filled with odds and ends.  Where it allegedly became personal was when scenes showing Kane's wife put through an humiliating run in showbiz propped up by Kane's largesse mirrored Hearst a bit too closely to real life.  Hearst reportedly offered to buy all copies of the film and told newspapers to not print anything or even mention its name.\n\n2. It heralded a new age of cinematography in 1941.  Citizen Kane pioneered in the mainstream many types of compositions and angles we now find quite common.  For a low angle shot in an office to show Kane's towering presence film cameras were too heavy and bulky to sit on the floor.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland solved this by having a hole dug deep enough for camera and tripod to achieve the desired effect.  Also the concept of \"deep focus\" or achieving a large depth of field to make characters near and far appear sharp is difficult to achieve.  These scenes were used to great effect to portray Kane as being surrounded and alone with his wealth later in the movie.  They also provided a literal window into a young innocent Kane during a tense scene inside the house, to which Kane was blissfully unaware but the audience experienced both to jarring effect.\n\n3. Orson Welles was famous and an excellent promoter.  Up to this point Welles most famous exploit had been his radio re-enactment of H.G. Wells \"War of the Worlds.\"  Choosing to follow a newsreel style format and not having an intro saying this is a work of fiction many listeners at home were swept up in the drama and thought an alien invasion was happening.  His popularity from this event carried a great deal of interest over to his first film.  For his first film to come together with a compelling story, technical wizardry, and cultural relevancy truly made it the standard for what a \"Best Film...\" should be.\n\nAs a sidenote in 1921 Citizen Kane won 9 Academy awards including Best Picture, Director, Editing, and Cinematography.

Frying shrimp that are larger than U-15 will result in tough shrimp.  First, clean and devein the shrimp, and then set them aside.  \n\nThen, heat vegetable, canola or peanut oil to 375 degrees.  These oils have a high smoke point (this is the temperature at which the oil will burn and smoke), and are good choices generally for frying.   Use a cast iron pan if you have one, or another good quality pan that retains heat evenly and well.  \n\nWhile the oil is heating, prep the flour. The crispness of the shrimp will depend on the type of flour that you use.  All purpose flour is readily available, and results in a nice, crispy shrimp.  Using rice flour will result in even more crispy shrimp, although rice flour is available at Asian grocery stores and is not readily available at general grocery stores. Using corn starch will result in the crispiest shrimp.  For one pound of shrimp, use 2 cups of whatever type of flour (or cornstarch) that you would prefer, and season the flour liberally with salt and pepper, and add some red pepper flakes if you prefer a little bit of spice.  \n\nAt this point, dry the shrimp and dredge the shrimp in the flour in relatively small batches.  Set aside until the oil is ready.\n\nOnce the oil is at 375 degrees, put a few shrimp in the oil, being careful not to crowd the pan.  Too many shrimp in the oil will result in less crispy shrimp, as well as shrimp that is oily.  You should use your judgment on how many shrimp to add, depending on the size of the shrimp and the size of the pan.  The shrimp will take only a few minutes in the oil to be done, again depending on the size of the shrimp.  The shrimp will be done once it\u2019s no longer translucent.  For shrimp that is 21/25 count or larger, using a spider (which is a type of skimmer) will make it easier to get the shrimp out of the pan.

The punched holes communicated a sequence of instructions and acted as on/off switches for devices such as self-playing pianos or looms. About a century later, Charles Babbage invented the first mechanical calculator, the Difference Engine using punch card instructions. Herman Hollerith continued developing this idea and made the Analytical Engine a reality by using punch holes to be a sequence of instructions and also store the instruction data on the device. In 1890, he developed a punch card data processing system for the US Census and went on to form the Tabulating Machine Company in 1896, later renamed International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). By the 1950s punch cards were being used regularly by the US government and industry.  Even today, punch cards are still used in standardized tests and voting ballots. Initially invented by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928, magnetic storage gradually replaced punch cards in the 1960s.  By 1965, Mohawk Data Sciences Corporation sold a key-to-tape magnetic tape device that was specifically marketed to replace the punch card.

This map was later included in a literary and historical atlas of America by Bartholomew in 1884, with light blue areas marking regions that were not originally present on the map.\n\nToscanelli served as an inspiration for Columbus, who received a letter from him on June 25, 1474. The letter was sent to canon Fernam Martins in Lisbon, who consulted Toscanelli on behalf of King Alfonso V about the possibility of reaching India through a western route.\n\nThe map clearly shows that Columbus was both inspired and misguided by Toscanelli's plan, which underestimated the Earth's circumference. This miscalculation led Columbus to believe that he had reached Japan instead of a completely new and unfamiliar continent lying between Europe and Asia.\n\nToscanelli's proposed plan involved sailing west along the equator to reach India and the wealthy countries of East Asia. The map that Toscanelli enclosed, which is now lost, included the western fringes of Europe and Africa, as well as the eastern fringes of Asia, with the Atlantic Ocean in between. However, Toscanelli mistakenly believed that the distance was only one-third of the Earth's circumference, far less than the actual distance.\n\nIn a letter, Toscanelli writes, among other things:\n\nI have already spoken once before of a route across the sea to the land of spices, much shorter than that of the Portuguese across Guinea.

While it is tempting to buy your dream supersport or touring cruiser, your first bike should be one that you can feel confident on so you can quickly master the skills necessary to ride a faster or larger bike more safely. Assess a new bike not from a place of desire, but from practical perspective, and consider these qualities:\n\n- Seat height: For most new riders, confidence comes more quickly when you can place both feet on the ground with a little bend in the knees. If you have a 32\" inseam, consider bikes with a 31\" or less seat height. If you have a 28\" inseam, consider bikes with a 27\" or lower seat height. Note that some bikes have wider \"waists\" that require you to spread your legs farther apart, so visit a dealer and sit on a variety of bikes until you find ones that you can sit comfortable atop with both feet planted.\n\n- Center of gravity: Bikes weigh from 250 lbs (dirt bikes) to over 800 lbs (large \"dresser\" cruiser bikes). Most bikes weigh between 400 and 600 lbs. However, weight isn't what makes a bike tip over easily -- rather, it's where the center of gravity is located. Sport bikes and adventure bikes carry their weight higher and more forward in the frame, where as standard and cruiser bikes carry it lower and closer to the rider. If you, as a new rider, grab a fistful of front brake during a low speed maneuver, what is going to cause the bike to start tipping over faster? Having a heavy weight high and forward. When assessing a first bike, look at where the engine and transmission mass seems to be centered relative to rider position. Sit on the bike with both feet planted and tilt it a little to the left and the right. Do you feel more or less strain on your shoulders as you bring it back it back to center? If you feel more, that sensation will become a danger when your learning low speed maneuvers and require more physical compensation, and will inhibit your ability to develop a good low speed riding technique.\n\n- Ergonomics: Most people feel cool in a racer's lean on a supersport, or slung back in a feet-forward posture when riding a cruiser. However, starting in those positions as a new rider can lead to discomfort, or inhibit your ability to develop solid basic riding techniques. Ideally, you want to be upright, elbows loose and bent and even with the bars. Your back should be straight with about a 5 degree forward lean. Your feet should be below your hips with a comfortable bend to the knees. In this position, you have the flexibility to better compensate for a lack of experience and technique when you encounter challenging situations on the road.\n\n- Engine displacement: Much ado is made about choosing the right displacement for a start bike. This is a bit of a myth: very few bikes, regardless of displacement, are fundamentally hostile to a new rider when it comes to engine performance: they are as fast or as slow as you treat the throttle. That said, smaller displacement bikes tend to be lighter, have lower seats, and are generally more newbie-friendly. However, some larger displacement bikes, including 650-900cc standards and 1100cc-plus cruisers can also be safe to learn on, as they favor low-revving torque over high-revving horsepower, with relatively gentle throttle response but plenty of grunt to push you forward from idle without extensive clutch feathering and rev management. Conversely, some smaller bikes, like the Kawasaki Ninja 250, require extensive revving and frequent gear shifting to get to street and highway speeds. Ask yourself: Do I want a light bike that will force me to learn good gear and rev management (a good idea if you have track aspirations), or a heavier bike that starts moving right off idle and requires less gear changing at street speeds? That's your answer to the question of displacement.\n\n- Throttle and brake response. Modern fuel injection, ECU development, and environmental emissions regulations have led to a situation where many sportier bikes have notchy throttles at low speeds, where closing the throttle cuts fuel and causes the bike to lurch a bit. This can be unpleasant for new riders who have yet to learn partial clutch management skills. Additionally, powerful sport bikes with inline-4 or V4 engine configuration can stutter and lurch at very low revs, requiring careful clutch and rev management that might be unfamiliar or uncomfortable to new riders -- these are bikes designed to be ridden fast, high in their powerbands. Additionally, powerful supersports and \"hooligan\" supermotos have very powerful brakes, like Brembo's Stylema or M4 units, which can easily pitch a new rider over the bars if they haven't developed a light, progressive touch on the brakes. If you, as a new rider, are having to spend your riding time compensating for unpredictable throttle behaviors or aggressive brakes, you aren't in a place to quickly learn good techniques safely.\n\nSo with all that in mind, what are some good starter bikes?\n\n- Kawasaki Ninja 400 or Z400: If your ambition is to ride a powerful supersport (like Kawasaki's own ZX-10R), start with a Ninja 400 or Z400. The Ninja is similar in style to supersport bikes, but has raised \"clip-on\" handle bars that convey the appearance of a racer but raise the incline of your posture to a more comfortable space. They also have a slightly lower seat height, and an accommodating 399cc parallel-twin motor with good throttle response and solid but unthreatening brakes. The Z400 is a more upright version of the Ninja 400 that shares the same engine and brakes, but lacks the plastic fairing and clip-on grips. Similar bikes include Yamaha's 321cc R3 and MT-03, Honda's CBR500F and CBR500R, KTM's RC390 and Duke 390, and BMW's G310. All of them perform very similarly, and are considered great gateway bikes to sport riding. Many track enthusiasts favor these bikes due to their light weight, engaging engines, and overall low cost of maintenance and insurance. If you really feel the need for speed so early in your riding career, Yamaha's MT-07 and Triumph's Trident 660 are relatively safe choices.\n\n- Triumph Street Twin 900. While well over 400 lbs, Triumph's Street Twin 900 is a very newbie friendly bike with a smooth, slow revving 900cc parallel-twin engine that puts down a lot of grunt and requires very little rev management -- you can short shift it any gear and still have the torque to move away cleanly without any fuss. Its comfortable seat and neutral \"standard\" riding position, along with its traction control and ABS features, mean that riding it is effortless and you won't be sore when you step off it after a long day cruising the backroads. It carries its weight low and close to the rider, and has a low-ish seat height of approximately 30\". Brakes are progressive without being intimidating, and a new rider will quickly learn good technique astride it. It also looks the part of a modern retro motorcycle, with clean curb appeal. Similar bikes include Moto Guzzi's V7 series, Kawasaki's Z650RS, and Royal Enfield's 650cc Interceptor.\n\n- Honda's Rebel 500. While it may not be the most eye-catching cruiser at the local Starbucks, Honda's Rebel 500 is a great gateway to the cruiser world. The 500cc engine is tuned for torque, not speed, and its low seat height of around 26\" means it is approachable by riders of all heights. It can keep up with larger bikes and serves as an effective commuter, with low costs of insurance and maintenance, and can be easily customized. Similar bikes include Royal Enfield's 350 Meteor and 650 Super Meteor, and Honda's 600cc Shadow line. For those not intimidated by weight, Harley-Davidson's 1700cc Heritage Softail is a surprisingly accommodating bike for new riders, with a low seat height and an impressive center of gravity that makes the bike feel a couple hundred pounds lighter once bumped off its kickstand. Avoid the older Sportster line, often inappropriately pitched as \"the Harley for new riders\" due to their relatively low displacements compared to KD's more upmarket models -- these bikes have very high-and-forward centers of gravity and weak front brakes that can easily inhibit your skills development.\n\nLastly, if you're looking at adventure bikes, Royal Enfield's 400cc Himalayan, Kawasaki's Versys 300X, and BMW's G310GS provide light weights, friendly engines, and reasonable seat heights all while being moderately well-equipped for gravel or graded dirt roads.\n\nThe most important thing, however, is to take the time to sit on the bikes at a dealer and think hard about the qualities discussed in this article. If you fall in love with the hobby, the bike you get today will not be the bike you have tomorrow. Focus on learning, not fashion, and make a choice that feels comfortable and safe to you.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What changes needs to be done in H1b lottery process", "context": "", "response": "The H1B filing procedure needs to be modified to include some reservation requirements.

In any social activity, there are guidelines for behavior. Mostly these guidelines are intended to make the social activity pleasant or fun for all the people involved. \nFor table manners, the rules are noticeably different among different cultures. Still, there are some common themes across cultures, for what is considered polite manners while eating. One common theme is to ensure that every person at the meal gets to eat. You can see this in the American table manner rule that nobody should not start eating until every person has been served their meal. In Mexican culture, any child who is nearby an outdoor party should be offered some of the party food. Another common theme about manners is that you should enjoy the food and the company, and not appear to simply be gobbling down as much food as possible. There are a lot of negative words to describe behavior that looks like eating too much or too fast, to be considered polite: being piggish, wolfing your food, gobbling, scarfing. \nOne rule that helps enforce slow eating, in American table manners, is that you shouldn't butter a whole piece of bread before eating it. Instead, you should tear the bread into smaller pieces, and butter only the piece you will eat next. Breaking the bread in half is considered a minimum level of politeness. Also, it's considered polite to leave one bite of each dish on your plate. If you eat everything, it could signal that you were just hungry, and eating everything available! But if you leave one bite, it signals \"I liked it, but had enough\". Americans also slow down eating by using both their fork and their knife in their right hands. This means that whenever you need to cut your food, you have to put down your fork, pick it up in your left hand, and pick up your knife in your right hand to cut your food. Before taking the bite, you have to do the opposite: put down your knife, pick up your fork in your right hand, and take your bite. This slows down eating a lot. (This rule is in contrast to table manners for the English, who keep their fork in their left hand and their knife in their right hand). Also, when eating soup, it's polite to push the spoon away from you, after filling it. Wipe the bottom of the spoon on the far side of your bowl, before bringing the spoonful of soup to your mouth. If you eat soup this way, you avoid scooping spoonfuls directly into your mouth -- which again, could look like you are just wolfing down food as fast as possible, instead of enjoying each mouthful.\nThere are also some table manner rules that provide signals to the servers or the waitstaff, without requiring verbal communications. For example, if you put down your fork pointing at 4:00 (with the handle pointing to the lower right of your plate), then it communicates \"I'm still eating\". But if you put your fork down, pointing at 10:00 or 11:00, then it communicates \"I'm finished with this food\". Then your server can take away your plate without interrupting the group conversation, which again is an example of making the social activity more pleasant for the participants. \nOverall, the rules of table manners evolved to make the social experience of eating a meal together a pleasant experience for everyone.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Why is Cricket popular in India?", "context": "", "response": "Cricket is the most popular sport in India.

You make a steep quick climb to a tilted cabin on a tilted road and you feel disoriented and seem to be at a severe incline when you enter this cabin. While there are various hypotheses as to reason for these effects, the most likely explanation is some level of optical illusion as the road is tilted at a severe opposite angle to the tilted roof line and the inside of the cabin. I think a combination of gravity hill where you get the sensation you are climbing up the road when in reality you are going down and the odd tilted angles of the cabin causes severe optical illusion. It also causes humans to fall back on visual senses more and ignore other senses which might be counter acting what you see.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Where is Florida?", "context": "", "response": "Florida is a state in the southeast corner of the continental United States of America.

A team is assembled to explore the domain of Area X, led by a character only known as the psychologist. The main character is known as the biologist. These expeditions are managed by a mysterious government organization known as the Southern Reach.\n\nThe expedition centers on two notable landmarks within Area X, the topological anomaly, which the biologists calls a tower but is really a tunnel, and a lighthouse. The expedition encounters an entity within the topological anomaly that \"writes\" living words of non-sense on the wall of the anomaly in fungus. \n\nEarly in the expedition, the biologist is contaminated by the fungus of the words in the anomaly, which grants her immunity to hypnotic suggestion, which the psychologist uses to control the other members of the expedition. The plot follows the biologist pursuing the psychologist in search of answers, leading a confrontation at the lighthouse. The psychologist jumps from the lighthouse, presumably forced to by the entity behind Area X, but lives long enough to confront the biologist. During the climax of that encounter, the psychologist shouts \"Annihilation!\" multiple times, and it is revealed that this is a hypnotic trigger word designed to induce suicide in the other expedition members.\n\nAfter the psychologist succumbs to her injuries at the base of the lighthouse, the biologist embarks on a journey north to an island that is possibly related to the disappearance of her husband, who was a member of the previous expedition.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What are important elements to consider when putting together a team to execute your operating model for AI?", "context": "", "response": "When building the right team to execute on your operating model for AI it is key to take into account the following elements:\n\n1) How mature is my data foundation: Whether your data is still in silos, stuck in proprietary formats or difficult to access in a unified way will have big implications on the amount of data engineering work and data platform expertise that is required.\n\n2) Infrastructure and platform administration: Whether you need to maintain or leverage as a service offerings can have a huge impact on your overall team composition.

Absolute pitch means that a note is represented as an absolute frequency, so if someone says \"A2\", that pitch can be mapped back to an exact frequency, and therefore can be reconciled among many different styles of music and instrumentation. \n\nIn contrast, much of Indian music (both classical and non-classical) uses the concept of relative pitch, which means that the musician sets a tonic note (their base note) and that pitch is the starting point for all other notes. For example, if one musician were to say that a specific pitch were \"sa\" (one of the 7 notes in the Indian music scale), another musician would not be able to reproduce that note, since they wouldn't know where the first musician set their tonic. However, this has other advantages,  because a tune is defined in terms of relative pitch and can be reproduced easily among different musicians and instruments without the worry of an absolute frequency which cannot be reached by a specific musical range.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What are the pros and cons of living in Seattle?", "context": "", "response": "Seattle is famous for its fusion of natural scenes ands city vibes.

In the United States, we have a system with two levels, a federal or national government, and underneath that state governments.  Dual federalism is a period between 1819 and 1936 where there was a clear separation of powers between the federal government and the state governments.  During this time the \u201cnational government left the states largely to their own devices in major policy areas\u201d which included \u201ceducation, transportation, and civil rights, among others\u201d.  \nDuring the dual federalism period, two important cases set the stage for the next time period called \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d (1936-present).  The first case was McCulloch v. Maryland which cited the Constitution's  supremacy clause and implied powers of the federal government in a verdict that prohibited the state of Maryland from taxing a federal bank.  The second case was Gibbons v. Ogden which cited the power of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce giving Gibbons a monopoly to ferry people from New Jersey to New York.  These two cases were used by the Federal government during the New Deal as precedent to enable cooperative federalism which is \u201can intermingling of power, policy, and resources among the national and state governments\u201d. The \u201cgovernment established programs providing federal funding in areas that were traditionally the exclusive domains of the state, such as health, transportation, education, employment, and poverty relief\u201d.

There are institutional as well as psychological factors that affect turnout. Institutional factors include voter registration requirements, timing and frequency of elections, location of polling places, and complexity of ballots. Psychological factors include political efficacy, interest and engagement of the electorate, and political party membership. Voter turnout in the United States can be increased, and I will propose two simple reforms that would increase voter turnout. I will also propose another more complex reform that would dramatically increase voter turnout but would be difficult to implement by the state governments.\nSeveral institutional factors determine voter turnout. As each state has the power to hold elections, these factors vary across the states. The difficulty or ease of voter registration will have an impact on turnout. Minnesota has a very high turnout allowing same-day voter registration, while Texas has a low turnout and has a 30-day requirement. The day and time an election is also held matters. For example, the U.S. holds federal elections on a Tuesday in November during work hours which reduces voter turnout. The frequency of elections will have an influence on turnout. There are many elections per year in the U.S., and voters get fatigued and stop going to the polls. Voters are also less likely to vote if they don't have convenient polling places that are nearby and easy to access. Schools are the best and most accessible polling locations, but the U.S. holds elections on Tuesdays, which limits the availability of school space and parking. Lastly, complex ballots diminish enthusiasm and negatively impact U.S. voter turnout.\nAlong with institutional factors, there are psychological factors that control voter turnout. One of which is political efficacy which is defined in two ways. The first is internal efficacy which is how well you think you are able to understand politics. The second is external efficacy which is how well you feel the system responds to your input. Essentially, if you think you are smart enough and your vote \"matters,\" you have high efficacy and tend to go to the polls. The next psychological factor is interest, which is a measure of how much you care about politics. If you don't care, it's highly unlikely that you will vote. The last psychological factor is partisanship. Are you a member of a political party? If yes, then it's more likely you'll go vote to support your party. \nBy voting age population, turnout in the U.S. is around 53%. This shows the United States has a low turnout compared to other democracies and puts the U.S. 7th from the bottom when compared to 35 other democracies. Australia has the highest turnout, with just over 90%. The reason for Australia's high turnout is that voting is compulsory, with fines for people who don't vote. \"Voting in Australia is like a party,\" with election day described as a country-wide BBQ with easy-to-access polling locations held on a Saturday. In Australia, \"Forcing people to engage in the process increases their knowledge of the issues and candidates,\" thereby increasing Australia's political interest and engagement. By contrast, polls in the U.S. consistently show us that Americans don't know much about politics and are neither engaged nor interested in politics. Converse argues that people in the U.S. have low levels of ideological constraint and conceptualization. This shows that Americans have low political efficacy.\n\tIn general American turnout is low, but Voter Eligible Population (VEP) turnout varies dramatically across the states. Hawaii has the least VEP turnout, with approximately 43%. To compare, the state with the highest VEP turnout is Minnesota, with 75%. Texas comes in 3rd from the bottom with 53%. Minnesota's high turnout is explained by \"easy access to the ballot,\" \"a sense of civic responsibility,\" \"high rates of educational attainment and income,\" and \"competitive and interesting elections.\" By comparison, the main reasons Hawaii turnout is so low are that it's \"hard to register,\" voter disinterest and low efficacy, and it's a \"one-party state\". This combination of institutional and psychological factors, beneficial in Minnesota, and detrimental in Hawaii, has a significant impact on a state's turnout. \n\tI propose two simple solutions to increase voter turnout. The first would be to move elections to the weekend or require that companies give employees the day off to vote. Sunday is the most common election day in the world outside the United States. I believe this would be a beneficial institutional factor that would increase voter turnout because the majority of other countries have higher voter turnout than the United States. Unfortunately, the chances of this happening are slim as Congress has proposed bills to move elections to the weekend or have a Federal holiday for voting, but these bills have never moved out of committees.\n\tThe second simple solution would address the institutional factor of registration requirements by implementing same-day voter registration in all 50 states. Minnesota allows for same-day registration, and its turnout is around 20% higher than Texas, which does not allow it. States that have implemented same-day voter registration have seen an average of a 5% increase in voters (\"Same Day Voter\"). To prevent voter fraud, systems should be put in place to make sure the voter hasn't already voted and to check for valid identification showing the voter is a resident of the state or county. Another deterrent to committing voter fraud would be criminal penalties, including jail time and fines. Enacting legislation in each state to implement a system to handle would take time, but I think it's possible as currently, 21 states allow same-day voting registration (\"Same Day Voter\"). \n\tThe third solution I propose would address most of the institutional factors. This would be an online/app-based voting option. The vast majority of Americans these days have mobile phones with internet connections. Those that don't would still have all of the current voting options, such as polling locations and mail-in voting. Security and verification would combine blockchain (similar to Bitcoin identities), biometrics, and facial recognition artificial intelligence. When registering to vote, a state agency would create your blockchain voter identification, fingerprint, and take a LiDAR(Light Detection and Ranging) 3D map of your face. These three technologies would ensure one vote per person. Also, this technology is all readily available and, while complex to implement, would provide several advantages over our current voting system. It would eliminate the need for convenient polling locations, as you can vote anywhere. The timing of elections would be fine, as you could vote during a work break. The frequency of elections would also be less of an issue because you wouldn't have to go to a polling location. The complexity of the ballot could be addressed in the application, which would allow links showing descriptions of candidates and issues.\n\tWhile voter turnout in the United States is low compared to other democratic countries, there are both simple and complex solutions that can increase voter participation. States with high voter turnout should be models for other states to follow as they have implemented practical reforms like same-day voter registration. The United States can then look to other countries and enact common sense solutions like voting on the weekend or on election holidays. Finally, we can use technology safely and responsibly to take voting into the 21st century and remove all the barriers to voting that our existing system places between the voter and the ballot.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Should I marry/ commit my significant other?", "context": "", "response": "Who you choose to spend the rest of your life with is one of the most important decisions you will ever make and one that not should be taken lightly.

Lower demand normally leads to dropping prices to try and motivate potential buyers. The other primary method involves open-market operations.

There are many different reasons that people decide to pursue getting their pilot's license including the challenge of learning a new skill, having the ability to travel by private plane for business or pleasure, sightseeing, or as a career option.  The process of learning to fly and getting your license requires several steps and usually takes about a year to complete.  The first step is to research local flight schools and potentially do a discovery flight with a flight instructor to see if you enjoy it before committing the time and money.  Should you decide to pursue it, you'll need to find and go to an Aviation Medical Examiner to get checked-out and have a student pilot and medical certificate issued.  Once you've completed that you can begin your training which will include both ground school and flight school.  The next step is to purchase the necessary books, study sufficiently and prepare to take an FAA written exam.  While you're studying, you'll begin your flight training which requires a minimum of 40 hours of flying, however most individuals end-up flying between 60 - 75 hours.  When your instructor feels you're able to demonstrate mastery of all of the required skills and are able to make sound decisions, you'll be ready to take a practical exam with either an FAA examiner or a designated examiner.   Upon successful completion of your test, you'll be issued your pilots license and be ready to take up passengers.  On average, the cost to get your pilot's license ranges from $8,000 to $12,000.

I typically activate the yeast in lukewarm water and sugar first, then mix all the ingredients in a stand mixer with a dough attachment.

It is mostly regarded as an \"upper-class\" sport reserved for members of private country clubs, but has gained a lot of popularity over the last few decades. As a result, golf has become more broadly accessible to the general public, and today the sport is enjoyed by tens of millions of people around the world. \n\nIn golf, there are a total of eighteen stretches of grass, known as holes. Each hole is comprised of a tee box, where the golfer hits his or her initial shot, the fairway, and the green. Most holes also include deep grass that runs along the fairways, known as \"the rough\". For added difficulty, holes can also contain hazards like sand bunkers or bodies of water like ponds and creeks. A small circular hole is located on every green and is marked with a flag so that golfers can see it from far away. The objective is to get your golf ball from the tee box into that small hole in as few shots (known as \"strokes\") as possible. Golfers advance their ball by striking it with a golf club, and each ball strike is counted as a stroke. Golfers are allowed to use up to 14 golf clubs over the course of their round, each of which is used for different purposes, from different distances. Some clubs, like the driver, are used to hit the ball very long distances. In fact, most professional golfers are able to drive the ball over 300 yards. That's the length of three football fields! A combination of clubs called irons make up the majority of a set of golf clubs. They are are generally used to advance the ball to the green after the golfer hits his or her initial tee shot. The club face of each iron is designed with a different loft angle. Higher loft angles enable golfers to hit the ball higher in the air and shorter distances, whereas low loft angles produce lower trajectory shots that travel longer distances. The most frequently used club in the set is the putter, which is used to tap the ball from wherever it lies on the green into the hole. On average, most good golfers will putt the ball twice per hole, or approximately 36 times per round. \n\nGolf holes are designated as par 3, par 4, or par 5, depending on their length. These numbers are an indication of how many strokes it should take for a professional golfer to complete the hole. Par 3 holes are shorter, and should take a single stroke to get the ball from tee to green. Par 5 holes are longer, and should typically take three strokes to get from tee to green. Most golf courses have four par 3 holes, four par 5 holes, and ten par 4 holes, yielding an aggregate of par 72. At the end of a round of golf, players calculate their final score by aggregating their total number of strokes across all eighteen holes. Over time, the golfer's skill level is assessed by his or her \"handicap\", which is a system that reflects the average number of strokes over par that the player typically shoots. For example, if one's average round score is 79, their handicap is 7 because it's 7 strokes above par. The lower the handicap, the better the golfer.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Who would win in a fight?

Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.\n\nIn some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise to a continuous and cheap source of energy, as used in nuclear power plants. Some countries get most of their energy today from nuclear fission.\n\nThe craziest thing about nuclear fission is that it was only discovered and put into use starting in the 1930s. It's such a new finding, and it's totally changed the world.

To eliminate this as a possibility and confirm the issue is not localized to your home, check to make sure that all circuits in your electric panel are still on. \n\nIf you are experiencing a power outage, it may been caused by a few different reasons:\n- Power safety shutoff: in some situations, a power provider will de-electrify an area to prevent issues. This might be due to maintenance activities with employees working on a section of the power grid, or to prevent issues in inclimate weather, such as preventing wildfire ignition in high-wind events. \n- Weather-caused issues: high wind or ice-storms can sometimes snap power lines or cause tree limbs to fall. \n\nCheck with your utility provider to stay up to date on any outage you are experiencing.

While there are a thousand possible paths, a handful of methods have proven consistently effective as triggers for moving prospects down the funnel toward purchase.\n\nThe first is personal referral. A personal referral or endorsement is worth more than 10,000 words of marketing material. Knowing that someone we know and trust can vouch for a product or service counts for so much that we will instinctually lower our guard and open our ears to a sales pitch.\n\nSecond is the testimonial. Like a referral, knowing that someone else -- generally a brand we know or at least can recognize -- uses a product or service predisposes us to try it ourselves. This is especially true of unknown brands or products. Think of when you pass a new restaurant. You may not know the name, the menu or the quality but if there's a crowd inside we naturally assume it must be good. The same goes for a new brand -- when you see others are endorsing it, we relax our natural suspicion and are more willing to give it a try.\n\nThird is the offer. It's not enough to build a great product. You have to overcome people's natural reluctance to open their wallets when you're asking them to pay full price. The offer can take many forms -- from a discount to a free trial to a bonus offer. Adding urgency -- such as a limited quantity or expiration on the offer can also help.\n\nFourth is the three-step. This works especially well for big-ticket items or purchases that involve a large number of people or disruption to an organization. The 3-step acknowledges that nobody buys a $2,000,000 solution without giving it a lot of thought. So first we simply get them to raise their hand and express interest. This can be done through a top-of-funnel asset like an eBook or webinar. The second step is an offer that gets them more involved with the product, such as a demo. And the third step is a face-to-face meeting with the sales team.\n\nFifth is third-party validation. Many prospects have an allergic reaction to anything that smells like marketing. But what if they are reading a glowing piece about your. in the Wall Street Journal? Or Gartner places you at the top of one of its magic quadrants? This kind of validation from what is perceived as an objective source carries a lot more weight than marketing content. \n\nIn practice, most businesses use a combination of the five techniques described above. Each will resonate in different ways with prospects; and in combination they can be extremely effective at creating that aura around your company and products that cause the prospect to push the \"Buy now\" button.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "When is the best time to catch Bass in Michigan?", "context": "", "response": "You have the best chance of hooking into a Bass in the early morning or evening on inland lakes in Michigan.

One of the worlds biggest cricket teams are India. The reason for so much popularity is multifold. Top reason is when English invaded South east asia they brought this game to the continent. Originally this game was only played by upper class, and later adopted by other classes as well. To play cricket you need one bat and one ball. Bat will be made up of wood and ball can be either tennis ball or hard ball which is made up of leather. You need a wicket which is 3 sticks and 2 bails on top. One person throws the ball and other person try to protect his wickets with the bat. The length of the wicket is 22 yards. Batsman can hit the ball for runs. To make runs, there are two ways. First is to hit the boundary, which can fetch either 4 or 6 runs. Second way is to run between the wickets and make as many runs as you can. There are other ways to get runs as well, like if its a wide ball or no ball. For a team to win a match, they either have to make more runs then the other team or get them all out before they can make more runs then them. Most popular cricket format is T20, then One day internationals (ODI) and then Test matches. T20 is the shortest form and have 20 overs and 2 innings. ODI has 50 overs and 2 innings.

Microsoft Outlook) and others allow the creation of \"labels\" (ex. Gmail). But in both cases, the application allows you to organize emails by using filters or rules to automatically store them in a particular folder or apply a specific label for easy retrieval at a later time. The key distinction, however, is that an email can belong to only one folder at a time i.e., a 1-1 relationship, whereas a variety of labels can be applied on a single email i.e., a 1-many relationship. I love using email filter rules just as much as anyone that's interested in taming their email Inbox. But I sometimes find myself not reading an important email either until it's very late or end up missing it entirely because the email skips the Inbox (where I spend most of my time) when a rule is triggered.

While both options have their advantages and disadvantages, many people wonder if it is better to buy a used car compared to a new car. In this article, we will explore the pros and cons of buying a used car and help you decide if it is the right choice for you.\n\nPros of Buying a Used Car\n\n1. Lower Price\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of buying a used car is the lower price. Used cars are typically much cheaper than new cars, even if they are only a few years old. This is because new cars lose value quickly as soon as they are driven off the dealership lot. By buying a used car, you can often get a great deal and save thousands of dollars.\n\n2. Lower Depreciation\n\nNew cars depreciate quickly in the first few years of ownership, often losing up to 50% of their value. Used cars, on the other hand, have already gone through this initial depreciation period, so they lose value at a much slower rate. This means that if you decide to sell your used car in a few years, you may not lose as much money as you would with a new car.\n\n3. Lower Insurance Costs\n\nInsurance costs for a used car are typically lower than for a new car. This is because used cars are less expensive, so the insurance company does not have to pay out as much if the car is damaged or totaled. Additionally, if you own the car outright, you may be able to choose a lower level of insurance coverage, which can further reduce your insurance costs.\n\n4. More Options\n\nWhen you buy a used car, you have a wider range of options to choose from than if you were buying a new car. You can choose from different makes, models, and years, and you may be able to find a car with features that are no longer available on new cars. This means that you can find a car that fits your specific needs and preferences.\n\n5. No Hidden Fees\n\nWhen you buy a new car, you may be charged various fees and expenses, such as a destination fee, dealer preparation fee, and advertising fee. With a used car, you do not have to worry about these hidden fees, as they have already been paid by the previous owner.\n\nCons of Buying a Used Car\n\n1. Higher Maintenance Costs\n\nUsed cars may require more maintenance and repairs than new cars, especially if they are older or have high mileage. This can result in higher maintenance costs, which can offset some of the savings you get from buying a used car.\n\n2. Higher Interest Rates\n\nIf you are financing a used car, you may have to pay a higher interest rate than if you were financing a new car. This is because lenders consider used cars to be a greater risk, as they are more likely to need repairs and maintenance.\n\n3. Limited Warranty\n\nMany used cars do not come with a warranty, or the warranty may have expired. This means that if something goes wrong with the car, you will have to pay for the repairs out of pocket. Some dealerships offer extended warranties for used cars, but these can be expensive.\n\n4. Unknown History\n\nWhen you buy a used car, you may not know the full history of the vehicle. The previous owner may not have disclosed all accidents or repairs, and there may be hidden issues that only become apparent after you have purchased the car.\n\n5. Less Advanced Features\n\nUsed cars may not have the latest technology and safety features that are available on new cars. This can be a disadvantage if you are looking for a car with advanced features, such as a backup camera or lane departure warning.\n\nConclusion\n\nBuying a used car can be a great option for many people, as it offers a lower price, slower depreciation, lower insurance costs, more options, and no hidden fees. However, there are also some disadvantages to buying a used car, such as higher maintenance costs, limited warranty, unknown history, higher interest rates, and less advanced features. Ultimately, the decision to buy a used car or a new car depends on your personal preferences and budget.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Write a review of Joe Abercrombie's book Before They Are Hanged", "context": "", "response": "There are some amazing action sequences in this sequel.

Usually, these learning objectives are skills-based and rely on an instructional designer's expertise to appropriately level the content and create activities based on task, skill and gap analysis. The content and activities created by an instructional designer is documented inside of a storyboard. The elearning developer then takes the storyboard and creates an interactive learning experience in software like Storyline 360 or Adobe Captivate.

During an emergency or other loss of power, helicopter pilots auto-rotate.  Auto-rotation is the decoupling of the rotor system from the engines to allow upward air flow to drive the rotor system at a faster than normal rate, providing kinetic energy that can be traded to arrest the helicopter's rate of descent.  To initiate auto-rotation, the helicopter pilot flattens the pitch in the rotor system's blades, reducing drag, and allowing the upward flow of air to drive its rotation.  When the helicopter is 100-150 feet above the ground, the pilot will then aggressively increase the pitch of the rotor system's blades, temporarily increasing lift and cushioning the helicopter's landing.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "Why is gluten bad for weight loss", "context": "", "response": "For centuries, gluten-free foods have provided people with protein, soluble fiber, and nutrients. \nGluten, especially gluten found in whole grains, is not bad for healthy people whose bodies can tolerate it.\nIt's common in bread, pasta, pizza, and cereal.

One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation.

GIS are used to fight crime, protect endangered species, reduce pollution, cope with natural disasters, treat epidemics, and improve public health; GIS are instrumental in addressing some of our most pressing societal problems.GIS tools in aggregate save billions of dollars annually in the delivery of goods and services. GIS regularly helps in the day-to-day management of many natural and man-made resources, including sewer, water,power, transportation networks, and package delivery. GIS are at the heart of one of the most important processes in U.S. democracy, decadal redrawing of U.S. congressional districts, and hence the distribution of tax dollars and other government resources.GIS are needed in part because human consumption has reached levels such that many resources, including air and land, replacing substantial limits on human action.The first 100,000 years of human existence caused scant impacts on the world's resources, but in the past 300 years humans have permanently altered most of the Earth's Surface. The atmosphere and oceans exhibit a decreasing ability to benignly absorb carbon dioxide and nitrogen, two of humanity's primary waste products. Silt chokes many rivers, and there are abundant examples of smoke, ozone, or other noxious pollutants substantially harming public health. By the end of the 20th century, most lands south of the boreal region had been farmed, grazed,cut, built over, drained, flooded, or otherwise altered by humans. GIS help us identify and address environmental problems by providing crucial information on where problems occur and who are affected by them. GIS helps us identify the source, location, and extent of adverse environmental impacts, and may help us devise practical plans for monitoring, managing, and mitigating environmental damage.Human impacts on the environment have spurred a strong societal push for the adoption of GIS. Conflicts in resource use,concerns about pollution, and precautions to protect public health have led to legislative mandates that explicitly or implicitly require the consideration of geography. The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a good example. The ESA requires adequate protection of rare and threatened organisms. This entails mapping the available habitat and species range and migration patterns, relative to human land use. \nGIS use is mandated in other endeavors, including emergency services, flood protection, disaster assessment and management, and infrastructure development.Public organizations have also adopted GIS because it aids in governmental functions. For example, emergency service vehicles are regularly dispatched and route using GIS. E911 GIS matches the caller's address to the nearest emergency service station, a route is generated based on the streetnetwork and traffic, and emergency crews dispatched in a fraction of the pre-GIS times.Many businesses adopt GIS for increased efficiency in the delivery of goods and services. Retail businesses locate stores based on a number of spatially related factors. Where are the potential customers?What is the spatial distribution of competing businesses? Where are potential new store locations? What are traffic flows near current stores, and how easy is it to park near and access these stores? GIS are also used in hundreds of other business applications, toroute vehicles, guide advertising, design buildings, plan construction, and sell real estate.The societal push to adopt GIS has been complemented by a technological pull in the development and application of GIS. Thousands of lives and untold wealth have been lost because ship captains could not answer the simple question, \u201cWhere am I?\u201dRemarkable positioning technologies, generically known as Global Navigation SatelliteSystems (GNSS), are now indispensable tools in commerce, planning, and safety.The technological pull has developed on several fronts. Spatial analysis in particular has been helped by faster computers with more storage, and by the increased interconnectedness via mobile networks. Most real-world spatial problems were beyond the scope of all but the largest organization until the 1990s. GIS computing expenses are becoming an afterthought as costs decrease and performance increases at dizzying rates. Powerful field computers are lighter, faster,more capable, and less expensive, so spatial data display and analysis capabilities may always be at hand.In addition to the computing improvements and the development of GNSS, current \u201ccameras\u201d deliver amazingly detailed aerial and satellite images. Initially,advances in image collection and interpretation were spurred by World War II and then the Cold War because accurate maps were required, but unavailable.Turned toward peacetime endeavors, imaging technologies now help us map food and fodder, houses and highways, and most other natural and human-built objects. Images may be rapidly converted to accurate spatial information over broad areas. Many techniques have been developed for extracting information from image data, and also for ensuring this information faithfully represents the location, shape, and characteristics of features on the ground. Visible light,laser, thermal, and radar scanners are currently being developed to further increase the speed and accuracy with which we map our world. Thus, advances in these three key technologies \u2014 imaging, GNSS, and computing \u2014 have substantially aided the development of GIS.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is an Italian Greyhound?", "context": "", "response": "Italian greyhounds are small dogs resembling racing greyhounds but are much smaller at around 15 pounds.

Paying particular attention to each will produce a consistent and delicious result.  First, confirm that your oven temperature is correct.  This is easily done with a meat thermometer.  Place the thermometer in the middle of the center rack of the oven, where most food cooks. Then preheat the oven to a baking temperature (e.g. 350 degrees).  After the oven has preheated, check the temperature on the thermometer and confirm that it also reads 350 degrees.   Second, bring your refrigerated ingredients to room temperature before using.  If your recipe calls for butter, do not microwave it as a shortcut.  Doing so will change the consistency of your batter.  Plan ahead and leave butter and eggs out on the counter for at least an hour before you begin baking.  Third, pay close attention to recipe instructions related to sifting and measuring flour.  \"Two cups sifted flour\" does not mean the same thing as \"two cups flour, sifted.\"  The first instruction means to sift the flour, then measure; whereas the second means measure first, then sift what was measured.  In either scenario, do not scoop the measuring cup into the flour bin directly.  This causes the flour to be tightly packed into the cup and will result in a cake that has the texture of a brick.  Instead, use a spoon to lightly scoop flour from the bin into the measuring cup, leveling off the top with a butter knife.  This method is messier, but will yield better results.  Fourth, take the time to cream the butter and sugar well.  The result should be smooth and lump free.  This is the most important step to making an appealing cake, and again can't be expedited by using melted butter!  Fifth, if your recipe calls for both wet ingredients (buttermilk, juice etc) and dry (flour mixture), alternate between the two in small increments rather than dumping them in sequentially.  This small step will protect the texture of your cake.  Sixth, once the cake batter has been poured into the pan, lift the pan and drop it onto the counter from a height of two to three inches.  This will remove any air pockets that may have developed in the batter.  Be careful not to bang the pan too hard, or you'll spill the batter and/or scare your pets out of the kitchen.   And lastly, don't bake the cake for as long as the recipe suggests. Set the timer a few minutes early so that you don't over-bake due to any idiosyncrasy associated with your oven (referenced in step one). Please note this does not mean you should be opening and closing the oven door multiple times during the baking process.  Good bakers know \"if you're looking, it's not cooking,\" so try not to open the oven until your timer goes off.  The only exception to this rule is if you smell something burning.  Odds are this means the batter has spilled out over the pan and onto the bottom of the oven.  if this happens, and the oven is now smoking, you have to open the door and try to remove the spill.  If nothing is smoking, leave the mess until the cake is out and the oven has cooled.  Back to the timer - When it goes off, quickly but carefully test the cake with several toothpicks in different areas while the cake remains in the oven. (Taking the cake in and out of the oven to test will change the temperature of both the oven and the cake).  If the toothpicks are wet and sticky, the cake needs more time. If the toothpicks are clean (or a tad moist), the cake is ready to come out of the oven.   Allow cake to cool on a rack, and then enjoy the fruits of your labor!", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is the Masters?", "context": "", "response": "The Masters Tournament is a golf tournament held annually in the first week of April at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.

This becomes the \"strictly dominate\" strategy as this allows the \"modern\" NBA team to shoot a higher volume of 3 pointers, which has a higher expected value per shot (40 Field Goal % times 3 = 1.2) than 2 pointers (50 Field Goal % times 2 = 1).

Many of the most popular shade trees are deciduous trees, however there are some great evergreen options as well.\n\nStarting with deciduous trees, there are flowering trees and traditional shade trees. Of the traditional shade trees, you may want to consider maples and oaks, of which there are many varieties. Red maples grow a bit slower than silver maples, but have hardier bark, beautiful red leaves in the fall, and a more pleasing traditional branching habit that many prefer vs, Silver maples. Sugar maples growth slower still, but are beautiful, prized trees that turn glowing orange in the fall and produce the sap used in maple syrup come spring. These trees can be 40-70 feet tall at maturity. Oaks are incredibly beautiful trees that are typically a little slower growing than maples, but have strong bark, enabling them to survive harsher conditions and have a long lifespan. They can handle being used as street trees as they do fine with moderate pollution levels and salt from de-icing. You really can't go wrong with maples or oaks as a summer shade tree, with their tall canopies providing wonderful shade once their leaves fill in during the spring.\n\nSome popular flowering options that provide ample shade include cherry and magnolia trees, both of which have beautiful showy spring flowers and reach a height of 20-60 feet at maturity depending on which of the many variants you choose (be careful with this as some are best suited to warmer climates and don't tolerate the cold as well). \n\nFor evergreens, the options are a bit more limited as many of these trees have low canopies that extend all the way to the ground. Many species of spruce and fir tree can have their canopies raised as they mature, creating space underneath for shade. Some pine trees have ample canopy under them, however their thin needle density can limit the amount of shade they provide.\n\nWhichever you ultimately choose, Shade trees add a ton of value to a home and are a great investment. Consider working with an arborist to make the decision based on your lighting and soil conditions. Enlisting a professional's help with planting will ensure your new tree is set up to grow healthy and strong.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What do I need to learn how to knit?", "context": "", "response": "To learn to knit you will need a few basic knitting supplies.

There is the thought is that the human body will self regulate what it needs instinctively.   The notion of self regulation applies to nutrients found in the food as well as the amount of food that the body need.  The mainstream alternative (especially in first world countries) is pureed foods prepared especially for babies. Those that subscribe to BLW believe that the downside of feeding babies baby specific food is that the practice teaches babies to ignore natural instincts because someone else is in control of what type and how much food to eat.  Some reasons people choose not to follow BLW are: the misconception that babies cannot eat solid food,  the convenience of prepared commercial baby food, generally accepted mainstream guidance on baby rearing, or the lack of awareness of BLW. BLW can also be quite messy as some of the food babies will handle are a function of exploration rather than for consumption and therefore end up on the floor.", "category": "general_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is the best smartphone on the market?", "context": "", "response": "The answer to this question depends on multiple parameters, such as: 1.) do you prefer an iOS or an Android phone 2.) do you prefer a small display or a large display 3.) which benchmark parameters are relevant for you.

Each team takes turns trying to hit a ball pitched to them by the opposing teams pitcher. If you hit the ball you run in order from first base to second to third and then home. Once the ball is hit the other team can tag you out with the ball that you hit. Each base is a safe spot to stand so you can stop at any base and let the next person on your team try to hit the ball and advance you to the next base. If you are tagged out then your team has an out. You get three outs in an inning. Once there are three outs you switch from hitting to pitching with the other team. When you are batting you get three strikes and four balls. If the pitcher throws four balls then you can walk to first base. This is called a walk. If you swing and miss the ball, that is called a strike. You can also strike out by not swinging at a pitch that is in an imaginary strike zone. This zone is there to give the pitcher something to aim and the hitter a reasonable area to hit a ball. There are 8 innings in a game. After 8 turns being up to bat the team with more runs wins.

Primary factors include head size, length, weight, stiffness, and swingweight  \n\nHead size - Power is closely correlated to head size - the larger the head size, the more power can be generated, all other factors being equal.  A larger head size also provides larger hitting area and 'sweetspot'.  Smaller head sizes tend to equate to more control and maneuverability. \n\nLength - The standard length is a 27 inches, but can range from 26.5 inches to 29 inches.  A longer racquets provides more reach and often results in more power.  Similar to head size, longer racquets may limit maneuverability and control. \n\nWeight - The heavier the racquet, the more power you will generate (increasing the 'swingweight') of the racquet.  The lighter the racquet, the more maneuverable and easier it will be for players to get the racket to the right swing position.  The balance of the racquet is also critical as part of weight.  A more head light racket (more weight in the handle) provides increased maneuverability, especially when using a heavier racquet. A more balanced or head heavy racket are often reserved for lighter racquets to maintain the mass behind the ball\n\nStiffness - Generally speaking, the stiffer the racket, the less energy is lost as the ball is redirected with your racquet and thus, creating more power.  More flexible racquets allow for more feel and control.  Flexible racquets provide more comfort as less shock and impact is transferred to the arm and elbow.\n\nSwingweight - Swingweight measures how heavy a racquet feels when you swing it and the amount of power you can transfer to the ball.

This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. \nThe earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.\nThe date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.\nFigs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.\nGrape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.\nFrom the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.\nHaving dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.\"\nFigs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.\nPlums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.", "response": "The earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes.

Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.", "response": "The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes.", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "Based on the above passage name some of the companies which specialize in large-scale construction of the\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0to support oil field exploitation.

The milk is traditionally from a cow, goat, sheep or buffalo, although, in theory, cheese could be made from the milk of any mammal. Cow's milk is most commonly used worldwide. The cheesemaker's goal is a consistent product with specific characteristics (appearance, aroma, taste, texture). The process used to make a Camembert will be similar to, but not quite the same as, that used to make Cheddar.\n\nSome cheeses may be deliberately left to ferment from naturally airborne spores and bacteria; this approach generally leads to a less consistent product but one that is valuable in a niche market.\n\nCulturing\nCheese is made by bringing milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid. These bacteria in the milk may be wild, as is the case with unpasteurised milk, added from a culture, frozen or freeze dried concentrate of starter bacteria. Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are homofermentative; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as carbon dioxide, alcohol, aldehydes and ketones are heterofermentative. Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, acid flavour is required. For cheeses such as Emmental the use of heterofermentative bacteria is necessary to produce the compounds that give characteristic fruity flavours and, importantly, the gas that results in the formation of bubbles in the cheese ('eye holes').\n\nStarter cultures are chosen to give a cheese its specific characteristics. In the case of mould-ripened cheese such as Stilton, Roquefort or Camembert, mould spores (fungal spores) may be added to the milk in the cheese vat or can be added later to the cheese curd.\n\nCoagulation\nDuring the fermentation process, once sufficient lactic acid has been developed, rennet is added to cause the casein to precipitate. Rennet contains the enzyme chymosin which converts \u03ba-casein to para-\u03ba-caseinate (the main component of cheese curd, which is a salt of one fragment of the casein) and glycomacropeptide, which is lost in the cheese whey. As the curd is formed, milk fat is trapped in a casein matrix. After adding the rennet, the cheese milk is left to form curds over a period of time.\n\n\nFresh chevre hanging in cheesecloth to drain.\nDraining\nOnce the cheese curd is judged to be ready, the cheese whey must be released. As with many foods the presence of water and the bacteria in it encourages decomposition. To prevent such decomposition it is necessary to remove most of the water (whey) from the cheese milk, and hence cheese curd, to make a partial dehydration of the curd. There are several ways to separate the curd from the whey.\n\n\nMaturing cheese in a cheese cellar\nScalding\nIn making Cheddar (or many other hard cheeses) the curd is cut into small cubes and the temperature is raised to approximately 39 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) to 'scald' the curd particles. Syneresis occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in a process known as 'cheddaring'. During this process the acidity of the curd increases to a desired level. The curd is then milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese moulds lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.\n\nMould-ripening\nMain article: Cheese ripening\nIn contrast to cheddaring, making cheeses like Camembert requires a more gentle treatment of the curd. It is carefully transferred to cheese hoops and the whey is allowed to drain from the curd by gravity, generally overnight. The cheese curds are then removed from the hoops to be brined by immersion in a saturated salt solution. The salt absorption stops bacteria growing, as with Cheddar. If white mould spores have not been added to the cheese milk it is applied to the cheese either by spraying the cheese with a suspension of mould spores in water or by immersing the cheese in a bath containing spores of, e.g., Penicillium candida.\n\nBy taking the cheese through a series of maturation stages where temperature and relative humidity are carefully controlled, allowing the surface mould to grow and the mould-ripening of the cheese by fungi to occur. Mould-ripened cheeses ripen very quickly compared to hard cheeses (weeks against months or years). This is because the fungi used are biochemically very active when compared with starter bacteria. Some cheeses are surface-ripened by moulds, such as Camembert and Brie, some are ripened internally, such as Stilton, which is pierced with stainless steel wires, to admit air to promote mould spore germination and growth, as with Penicillium roqueforti. Surface ripening of some cheeses, such as Saint-Nectaire, may also be influenced by yeasts which contribute flavour and coat texture. Others are allowed to develop bacterial surface growths which give characteristic colours and appearances, e.g. by the growth of Brevibacterium linens which gives an orange coat to cheeses.", "response": "The main ingredient used to make cheese is milk. Cow's milk is commonly used, though goat, sheep or buffalo can also be used, as could the milk of any mammal in theory. Starter cultures are typically added to aid in the culturing stage of the process. Rennet is added to the cheese milk to promote the separation into cheese curd and whey. Ultimately, salt is added to halt the production of acid later in the process. Finally, mould spores are introduced to assist in ripening. This can be added to the cheese milk early on in the process, or just prior to maturing.", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "Given this paragraph, extract a list of names that are playable by the user of this game.", "context": "During the single-player campaign, the player controls five different characters from a first-person perspective.

She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, whose singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her 2022 album Midnights and single \"Anti-Hero\" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and played supporting roles in others.\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history.

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.", "response": "Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish.

Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance.

Together with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early civilisations of the Near East and South Asia, and of the three, the most widespread. Its sites spanned an area from much of Pakistan, to northeast Afghanistan, and northwestern India. The civilisation flourished both in the alluvial plain of the Indus River, which flows through the length of Pakistan, and along a system of perennial monsoon-fed rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the Ghaggar-Hakra, a seasonal river in northwest India and eastern Pakistan.\n\nThe term Harappan is sometimes applied to the Indus civilisation after its type site Harappa, the first to be excavated early in the 20th century in what was then the Punjab province of British India and is now Punjab, Pakistan. The discovery of Harappa and soon afterwards Mohenjo-daro was the culmination of work that had begun after the founding of the Archaeological Survey of India in the British Raj in 1861. There were earlier and later cultures called Early Harappan and Late Harappan in the same area. The early Harappan cultures were populated from Neolithic cultures, the earliest and best-known of which is Mehrgarh, in Balochistan, Pakistan. Harappan civilisation is sometimes called Mature Harappan to distinguish it from the earlier cultures.\n\nThe cities of the ancient Indus were noted for their urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems, water supply systems, clusters of large non-residential buildings, and techniques of handicraft and metallurgy. Mohenjo-daro and Harappa very likely grew to contain between 30,000 and 60,000 individuals, and the civilisation may have contained between one and five million individuals during its florescence. A gradual drying of the region during the 3rd millennium BCE may have been the initial stimulus for its urbanisation. Eventually it also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation's demise and to disperse its population to the east.\n\nAlthough over a thousand Mature Harappan sites have been reported and nearly a hundred excavated, there are five major urban centres: Mohenjo-daro in the lower Indus Valley (declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980 as \"Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro\"), Harappa in the western Punjab region, Ganeriwala in the Cholistan Desert, Dholavira in western Gujarat (declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2021 as \"Dholavira: A Harappan City\"), and Rakhigarhi in Haryana.

Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC).

The distance is measured by a function called a metric or distance function. Metric spaces are the most general setting for studying many of the concepts of mathematical analysis and geometry.\n\nThe most familiar example of a metric space is 3-dimensional Euclidean space with its usual notion of distance. Other well-known examples are a sphere equipped with the angular distance and the hyperbolic plane. A metric may correspond to a metaphorical, rather than physical, notion of distance: for example, the set of 100-character Unicode strings can be equipped with the Hamming distance, which measures the number of characters that need to be changed to get from one string to another.\n\nSince they are very general, metric spaces are a tool used in many different branches of mathematics. Many types of mathematical objects have a natural notion of distance and therefore admit the structure of a metric space, including Riemannian manifolds, normed vector spaces, and graphs. In abstract algebra, the p-adic numbers arise as elements of the completion of a metric structure on the rational numbers. Metric spaces are also studied in their own right in metric geometry and analysis on metric spaces.\n\nMany of the basic notions of mathematical analysis, including balls, completeness, as well as uniform, Lipschitz, and H\u00f6lder continuity, can be defined in the setting of metric spaces. Other notions, such as continuity, compactness, and open and closed sets, can be defined for metric spaces, but also in the even more general setting of topological spaces.", "response": "The third metric or distance function that was encountered in this example is the Hamming distance.

This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. \nThe earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.\nThe date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.\nFigs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.\nGrape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.\nFrom the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.\nHaving dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: \"She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.\"\nFigs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.\nPlums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.", "response": "Figs were extremely popular in Rome.

List the results in comma separated format.", "context": "Once, the sages wanted to decide the deity to dedicate a ritual. The sages appointed the sage Bhrigu to select the god. Bhrigu decided to test the gods. He first went to the King of Svarga, Indra, who ignored the sage, and was busy in enjoying the dance of apsaras in heaven. Bhrigu cursed Indra that he would only be referred to as an egoistic soul, all over the universe. He next visited Brahma. Brahma was busy with his four heads in chanting the Vedas, performing meditation, creating the world, and spending his time with his wife, Saraswati. Next, he visited Shiva. Shiva was busy in his Rudradhyanam with his wife, Parvati, at his feet. Bhrigu cursed Shiva that he would be worshipped only in the formless Lingam. At last, Bhrigu went to Vishnu. Vishnu was sleeping on Adishesha, and Lakshmi was at his feet. When Bhrigu arrived, he first saw Vishnu's feet, and felt humiliated. Enraged, he kicked Vishnu on his chest. Awakened, Vishnu started massaging Bhrigu's feet, and served him with great hospitality. Bhrigu was pleased, and ordered the sages to perform the rites to Vishnu. Lakshmi quarreled with Vishnu, as she felt that Bhrigu insulted her indirectly by hitting Vishnu on his chest where she lived, and thus left Vaikuntha.\n\nShe settled on earth in disguise as a young-sage like boy in the ancient city of Karvir, and meditated the name of Vishnu (Regarded by adherents to be the site of the Mahalakshmi temple). Vishnu soon arrived on earth, searching for his consort. He failed to find her, and instead settled on the Seshachalam hills. This happened to be the spot in Tirupati where Varaha had rested and taught Karma Yoga to the people till the beginning of Kali Yuga, after having rescuing Bhudevi from the wicked Hiranyaksha. Vishnu sat inside an anthill in his disguise, which was situated under a tamarind tree, and started chanting the name of his wife, Mahalakshmi.\n\nThe whole earth became gloomy. On the request of Parvati and Saraswati, Shiva and Brahma incarnated as a cow and a calf respectively, in the Chola kingdom. This cow and calf were being grazed daily by a shepherd of Chola kingdom in the Seshachalam hills. Everyday, the cow used to pour her milk into the anthill to lessen the thirst of Vishnu. Due to this, the cow and calf became pale and unhealthy. The shepherd noticed this, and felt that something was awry. The next day, the shepherd took the animals for grazing, and as was the custom, the cow poured milk into the anthill. The shepherd saw this act, and he threw an axe (parasu) on the cow and calf. Vishnu noticed, and in order to protect them, Vishnu arose from the anthill and the axe hit his own forehead (the blood poured as his namam on his head). An enraged Vishnu cursed the shepherd that he would die immediately, and the latter succumbed to the blow of his own axe. This news reached the Chola king. The ruler suspected the absence of the shepherd. He went near the grazing field, and was surprised to see the corpse of the shepherd. He went to the grazing field, where the cows were offering their milk to Vishnu. However, Vishnu was in disguise, and so the king could not identify him. The king strung his arrow, believing that the milk should serve the kingdom rather than the boy he saw. Vishnu, once again, emerged, and grew enormous, stopped the arrows from passing further and he cursed the king for not maintaining the dharma of his kingdom. The king repented and surrendered at the deity's feet. Unlike the shepherd, the king had realised his mistake, which pleased Vishnu, and hence presented him with the boon that he would marry the king's daughter in his next birth.\n\nIn his next birth, Vishnu incarnated as Srinivasa, to a woman named Vakuladevi. It is said that in the Dvapara Yuga, Krishna presented Yashoda with a boon that he would be born to the former in the Kali Yuga. Vakuladevi is regarded as the reincarnation of Yashoda. Meanwhile, the goddess Lakshmi was born at the palace of Akasha Raja, the next birth of the Chola king. Srinivasa was a forest-dweller. One day, he met a beautiful girl named Padmavati, the princess of the Chola dynasty. Padmavati fell in love with Srinivasa , and decided to marry him. According to the boon of Vishnu to the Chola king in their previous births, Srinivasa has to marry Padmavati, princess of Chola dynasty.

He devoted much of his life to the conservation of bush remnants on the Port Hills on Banks Peninsula, and a key element in his scheme was to make the area accessible to the public. To that end, he proposed a Summit Road that would go along the hilltops, connecting Godley Head with the tops above Akaroa. Whilst most of the public believed that the scenic reserves to be formed were too remote, Ell had a way with landowners and organised some government funding. His usual style was to pay a deposit for land, with the remainder to be raised later. In 1909, he decided to form a Summit Road Scenic Reserve Board to help with the task of establishing his dream, but there was tension over their scope.

Separate them with a comma.", "context": "There is one globally recognized approach for defining and measuring hunger generally used by those studying or working to relieve hunger as a social problem. This is the United Nation's FAO measurement, which is typically referred to as chronic undernourishment (or in older publications, as 'food deprivation,' 'chronic hunger,' or just plain 'hunger.') For the FAO:\n\nHunger or chronic undernourishment exists when \"caloric intake is below the minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER). The MDER is the amount of energy needed to perform light activity and to maintain a minimum acceptable weight for attained height.\" The FAO use different MDER thresholds for different countries, due to variations in climate and cultural factors. Typically a yearly \"balance sheet\" approach is used, with the minimum dietary energy requirement tallied against the estimated total calories consumed over the year. The FAO definitions differentiate hunger from malnutrition and food insecurity:\nMalnutrition results from \"deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in the consumption of macro- and/or micro-nutrients.\" In the FAO definition, all hungry people suffer from malnutrition, but people who are malnourished may not be hungry. They may get sufficient raw calories to avoid hunger but lack essential micronutrients, or they may even consume an excess of raw calories and hence suffer from obesity.\nFood insecurity occurs when people are at risk, or worried about, not being able to meet their preferences for food, including in terms of raw calories and nutritional value. In the FAO definition, all hungry people are food insecure, but not all food-insecure people are hungry (though there is a very strong overlap between hunger and severe food insecurity.). The FAO have reported that food insecurity quite often results in simultaneous stunted growth for children, and obesity for adults. For hunger relief actors operating at the global or regional level, an increasingly commonly used metric for food insecurity is the IPC scale.\nAcute hunger is typically used to denote famine like hunger, though the phrase lacks a widely accepted formal definition. In the context of hunger relief, people experiencing 'acute hunger' may also suffer from 'chronic hunger'. The word is used mainly to denote severity, not long-term duration.\nNot all of the organizations in the hunger relief field use the FAO definition of hunger. Some use a broader definition that overlaps more fully with malnutrition. The alternative definitions do however tend to go beyond the commonly understood meaning of hunger as a painful or uncomfortable motivational condition; the desire for food is something that all humans frequently experience, even the most affluent, and is not in itself a social problem.\n\nVery low food supply can be described as \"food insecure with hunger.\" A change in description was made in 2006 at the recommendation of the Committee on National Statistics (National Research Council, 2006) in order to distinguish the physiological state of hunger from indicators of food availability. Food insecure is when food intake of one or more household members was reduced and their eating patterns were disrupted at times during the year because the household lacked money and other resources for food.

On a baseball field, the game is under the authority of several umpires. There are usually four umpires in major league games; up to six (and as few as one) may officiate depending on the league and the importance of the game. There are three bases. Numbered counterclockwise, first, second, and third bases are cushions (sometimes informally referred to as bags) shaped as 15 in (38 cm) squares which are raised a short distance above the ground; together with home plate, the fourth \"base\", they form a square with sides of 90 ft (27.4 m) called the diamond. Home plate is a pentagonal rubber slab 17 in (43.2 cm) wide. The playing field is divided into three main sections:\n\nThe infield, containing the four bases, is for general defensive purposes bounded by the foul lines and within the grass line (see figure).\nThe outfield is the grassed area beyond the infield grass line between the foul lines and bounded by a wall or fence.\nFoul territory is the entire area outside the foul lines.\nThe pitcher's mound is located in the center of the infield. It is an 18 ft (5.5 m) diameter mound of dirt no higher than 10 in (25.4 cm). Near the center of the mound is the pitching rubber, a rubber slab positioned 60 ft 6 in (18.4 m) from home plate. The pitcher must have one foot on the rubber at the start of every pitch to a batter, but the pitcher may leave the mound area once the ball is released.\n\nAt the college/professional level, baseball is played in nine innings in which each team gets one turn to bat and tries to score runs while the other pitches and defends in the field. High school baseball plays seven innings and Little League uses six-inning games. An inning is broken up into two halves in which the away team bats in the top (first) half, and the home team bats in the bottom (second) half. In baseball, the defense always has the ball\u2014a fact that differentiates it from most other team sports. The teams switch every time the defending team gets three players of the batting team out. The winner is the team with the most runs after nine innings. If the home team is ahead after the top of the ninth, play does not continue into the bottom half. When this happens, an X is put on the scoreboard for the home team's score in the ninth inning. In the case of a tie, additional innings are played until one team comes out ahead at the end of an inning. If the home team takes the lead anytime during the bottom of the ninth or of any inning after that, play stops and the home team is declared the winner. This is known as a walk-off.\n\nThe basic contest is always between the pitcher for the fielding team and a batter. The pitcher throws\u2014pitches\u2014the ball towards home plate, where the catcher for the fielding team waits (in a crouched stance) to receive it. Behind the catcher stands the home plate umpire. The batter stands in one of the batter's boxes and tries to hit the ball with a bat. The pitcher must keep one foot in contact with the top or front of the pitcher's rubber\u2014a 24\u00d76 in (61\u00d715 cm) plate located atop the pitcher's mound\u2014during the entire pitch, so he can take only one step backward and one forward in delivering the ball. The catcher's job is to receive any pitches that the batter does not hit and to \"call\" the game by a series of hand movements that signal to the pitcher what pitch to throw and where. The catcher also usually signals the desired location of the ball within the strike zone and \"sets up\" behind the plate or holds his glove up in the desired location as a target. The catcher's role becomes more crucial depending on how the game is going, and how the pitcher responds to a given situation. Each pitch begins a new play, which might consist of nothing more than the pitch itself.\n\nEach half-inning, the goal of the defending team is to get three members of the other team out. A player who is out must leave the field and wait for his next turn at bat. There are many ways to get batters and baserunners out; some of the most common are catching a batted ball in the air, tag outs, force outs, and strikeouts. After the fielding team has put out three players from the opposing team, that half of the inning is over and the team in the field and the team at bat switch places; there is no upper limit to the number that may bat in rotation before three outs are recorded. Going through the entire order in an inning is referred to as \"batting around\" and it is indicative of a high-scoring inning. A complete inning consists of each opposing side having a turn (three outs) on offense.\n\nThe goal of the team at bat is to score more runs than the opposition; a player may do so by batting, then becoming a baserunner, touching all the bases in order (via one or more plays), and finally touching home plate. A player may also become a baserunner by being inserted as a pinch-runner. To that end, the goal of each batter is to enable baserunners to score or to become a baserunner himself. The batter attempts to hit the ball into fair territory\u2014between the baselines\u2014in such a way that the defending players cannot get them or the baserunners out. In general, the pitcher attempts to prevent this by pitching the ball in such a way that the batter cannot hit it cleanly or, ideally, at all.\n\nA baserunner who has successfully touched home plate without being retired (called out) after touching all previous bases scores a run. In an enclosed field, a fair ball hit over the fence on the fly is an automatic home run, which entitles the batter and all runners to touch all the bases and score. On a field with foul poles, a ball that hits a pole is also a home run. A home run hit with all bases occupied ('bases loaded') is called a grand slam.", "response": "Baseball is a game contested between two teams of 9 players. The defense plays the field and has the ball, and the offense can score by batting the ball and making their way around the bases. The field consists of two parts, the infield, which contains the bases, and the outfield. The bases are 90 feet apart, arranged in diamond format, and advanced counterclockwise. The pitcher's mound is in the center of the infield and is 60 feet 6 inches away from home plate (where the batter stands to try and bat the ball). At the youth level, the bases may be placed as close as 60 feet apart, and the mound may be as close as 46 feet away. The infield contains 6 of the 9 defenders, the pitcher being on the pitcher's mound, the catcher positioned behind home plate to receive the ball from the pitcher, and 4 infielders. The 1st baseman and 2nd baseman are positioned on the right side of the infield near their respective bases. The shortstop and third baseman are positioned on the left side of the infield with the shortstop shaded closer to 2nd base, in a mirrored position from the 2nd baseman. The third baseman is positioned by third base. The outfielders are the 3 remaining defensive players positioned in the large grass outfield in a left, center, and right arrangement. The pitcher must deliver the ball over the plate at the height range of the player's knees to their torso. 3 pitches at this level or swings and misses count as an out. Balls batted that don't land in play, which the lines of play extend from the point of the home plate which is a 90-degree angle count as a strike as long it strikes one or two, a batter cannot foul out for the third strike. If a pitched ball is not called a strike it is a ball, and 4 balls in an at-bat award the batter first base via what is called a walk. Other ways to make outs are if a ball is batted and the fielders catch it before it hits the ground; if the ball hits the ground the runner can be declared out of the fielders touch the base of the advancing runner with possession of the ball prior to the runners' arrival, so long as the runner is forced to advance to the base. If there is no force, the runner must be tagged out. In the event of a fly-out, any runner must re-establish possession of the bag they started at and are not allowed to advance to the next base until the fielder catches the ball. If they don't re-establish possession of their originating base they can be called out if the ball and the fielder possessing it reaches the originating base before they do. 3 outs constitute a half-inning; after each half-inning, the teams rotate from offense to defense. After each team gets 3 outs the full inning is concluded. A game is complete after 9 innings, although youth games are usually 6 or 7 innings. If the teams are tied at the end of regulation, the teams will continuously add extra innings until the tie is broken. A ball that is batted over the outfield fence is considered a homerun and the batter and all base runners can advance safely to home. If a battled ball lands in fair territory and leaves the field of play, it is considered a ground-rule double, and all runners are awarded two bases from where they started. You can substitute players from your bench into the game at any time but players are not allowed to re-enter the game once substituted, so substitutions are done sparingly and strategically. Many leagues employ the designated hitter rule, which allows for a 10th player to bat in place of the pitcher. Balls, strikes, and outs are called by umpires, of which there can be anywhere between 2 and 4.", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "What fruits and vegetables are grown in lower-lying areas of Kenya?", "context": "Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa.

She confides in Poirot that she will soon be murdered, and that nothing can be done to stop it; after refusing Poirot's assistance, Jennie departs in distress, and Poirot is unable to find out anymore information from the staff about Jennie or her address. After returning to the guest house where he is staying, Poirot describes the events to Edward Catchpool, an officer at Scotland Yard - Catchpool reveals that he has spent the day investigating three murders at the luxurious Bloxham Hotel; two women and a man, all in separate rooms, were found dead earlier in the evening, each with a monogrammed cufflink (with the letters 'PJI') in their mouths.\n\nThe following day, Poirot and Catchpool attend the scene of the crime where they discover more details about the victims with the hotel's owner, Luca Lazzari; the victims (Harriet Sippel, Ida Gransbury and Richard Negus) had all arrived at the hotel separately on the same day; each victim was found in their locked hotel rooms; the murders occurred between 19:15 and 20:10 (all three victims were seen alive at 19:15 by hotel staff); Mr. Negus had booked the rooms for all three victims and paid for them ahead of time; a junior clerk saw Mr. Negus in the reception area 15 minutes after room service was provided for the victims. Later on, it's revealed that all three victims had lived in a village called Great Holling, and that Mr. Negus had been engaged to Ida - in addition, Richard had left Great Holling in 1913 after the deaths of the village vicar and his wife, Patrick and Frances Ives. Poirot sends Catchpool to Great Holling to discover more information about the victims. After arriving in the village, Catchpool meets Margaret Ernst, widow of the most recent vicar for the village. After some reluctance, Margaret relays to Catchpool the events of 1913. The vicar's maid had told Harriet Sippel a rumour that the vicar was taking money from villagers to help them 'communicate' with deceased loved ones. Harriet spread the rumour around the village, with the support of Ida and Mr. Negus. The rumours spiralled until there were calls to remove Ives as Vicar, and Frances' health declined as a result. Eventually, unable to bear the rumours any longer, Frances took her own life, with the heartbroken vicar following shortly afterwards. After some questioning, Catchpool learns that the maid who told the original lie was Jennie Hobbs - the same Jennie that Poirot has been searching for all this time.\n\nMeanwhile, as Catchpool is leaving London, Poirot arranges to meet with Nancy Ducane, a famous artist who was seen to be leaving the hotel shortly after the murders - Nancy was also mentioned in Margaret's story as the villager seen to be visiting the church at night with Ives. During the visit, Nancy recognises the names of various Great Holling residents but refuses to provide anymore details. However, Poirot and Constable Stanley Beer find a pair of keys that correspond to two of the victims' hotel rooms. Whilst visiting the home of Nancy's friend to confirm her alibi, Poirot notes several details from different paintings within the house. Shortly after returning home, Poirot learns from Scotland Yard that a fourth murder has occurred at the Bloxham - with Catchpool, the two gentlemen return to the hotel - they find a pool of blood, a monogrammed cufflink and (to Poirot's dismay) Jennie's hat within the room. After returning to their guest house, Poirot and Catchpool are visited by Nancy, who confesses her connection to the events in Great Holling; she was having an affair with Ives, and Jennie - who was also in love with the vicar - had spread the rumours out of jealousy. Nancy's attempts to placate the villagers by telling the truth were dismissed, and indeed further ruined the reputation of the vicar. The following day, Poirot takes Catchpool to visit the address of Samuel Kidd, the witness who saw Nancy at the hotel. However, instead of Samuel, they are greeted by Jennie Hobbs who - Poirot reveals - was formerly engaged to Samuel before she met the vicar. After listening to her testimony, Poirot and Catchpool return to Great Holling in response to a serious attack on Margaret - after speaking with the village doctor, Ambrose Flowerday, Poirot decides to return to the Bloxham one last time to resolve the case.\n\nAt the hotel, Poirot gathers the hotel staff and suspects together to reveal the solution; Nancy Ducane and Jennie Hobbs (with Kidd's assistance) had conspired to kill the three victims. Nancy & Kidd had impersonated Harriet & Mr. Negus at 19.15, and Kidd was the gentleman seen by the clerk at the front desk at 19.30. Nancy confesses to the crimes, but is fatally stabbed by Jennie. At Scotland Yard, Jennie, confesses her side of the story; In 1913, the rumour that Jennie had created was actually intended to save Ives from the scandal of his affair with Nancy. Harriet was convinced that the vicar could help her speak to her dead husband, and upon being refused, viciously spread the rumour in Great Holling. Years later, Mr. Negus contacted Jennie out of remorse for his actions, and the two people hatched a plan to kill all four guilty parties involved in the rumour. Mr. Negus and Jennie would lure Harriet and Ida to the Bloxham under false pretenses and poison them separately; Mr. Negus would then poison Jennie, and finally himself. However, Jennie secretly revealed the plan to Nancy to avoid her own death, and convinced Richard to die before her so that she could find justice against Nancy. Mr. Negus agreed to this plan, and Jennie arranged the scene to look like Mr. Negus had killed himself. Jennie had killed Nancy after she revealed at the meeting that her relationship with Ives had been a physical one, rather than the chaste romance that Jennie had been led to believe.\n\nFour days after Jennie and Kidd's arrest, Poirot and Catchpool receive a letter from Dr Flowerday and Margaret Ernst; they have harboured feelings for each other for years, and after Poirot's intervention have decided to marry.", "response": "1.

It is an example of cannibalization.\nThe term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.\"\n\nOsborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available.

Sh\u014dyu ramen usually has curly noodles rather than straight ones, although this is not always the case.

Miso ramen broth tends to have a robust, tangy flavor, so it stands up to a variety of flavorful toppings: spicy bean paste or t\u014dbanjan (\u8c46\u74e3\u91a4), butter and corn, leeks, onions, bean sprouts, ground pork, cabbage, sesame seeds, white pepper, chilli and chopped garlic are common. The noodles are typically thick, curly, and slightly chewy.\nKar\u0113 (\u30ab\u30ec\u30fc, 'curry') ramen is a relative newcomer, cooked with curry soup. In Japan, several cities claim to be its place of origin. The city of Muroran claims it originated there in 1965 (see also Muroran curry ramen), while the city of Sanj\u014d claims to have had kar\u0113 ramen for over 80 years, and the city of Katori also claims to have been the site of its origin. Curry soup is mainly made with pork bones and vegetables and is seasoned with curry. The noodles are thick and curly.

The book is recognized as a classic in children's literature, and is one of the best-selling books of all time with over 100 million copies sold.\n\nThe Hobbit is set in Middle-earth and follows home-loving Bilbo Baggins, the titular hobbit, who joins the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves that make up Thorin Oakenshield's Company, on a quest to reclaim the dwarves' home and treasure from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo's journey takes him from his peaceful rural surroundings into more sinister territory.\n\nThe story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature or type of creature of Tolkien's geography. Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict.\n\nPersonal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view Tolkien's own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in mythology and fairy tales are often noted as influences.\n\nThe publisher was encouraged by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on its successor, The Lord of the Rings, he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.\n\nThe work has never been out of print.

The country is the fifth largest oil producing nation in Africa, which has helped drive its strong growth in the later 20th century.\n\nThe oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP and 80% of exports. Although there have been recent offshore finds, oil production is now declining from its peak of 370,000 barrels per day (59,000 m3/d) in 1997, and periods of low oil prices have had a negative impact on government revenues and the economy. In 2012 there were six active oil rigs in Gabon.\n\nThe government has plans to diversify its economy away from its dwindling oil reserves. The government announced in 2012 that it would reassess exactly how much iron ore the Belinga site contains before awarding the concession to a mining company, most likely to be China's CMEC, which temporarily secured the rights to the ore in 2007.\n\nAround 80% of Gabonese live in cities.

He received a Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, and later graduated from Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale; they married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive tenures as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential election, defeating incumbent Republican president George H. W. Bush and independent businessman Ross Perot. At 46 years old, he became the third-youngest president of the United States and the first president to be born in the Baby Boomer generation.\n\nClinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. The Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in the 1994 elections, but Clinton was still comfortably re-elected in 1996, becoming the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second full term. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing the Dayton Peace agreement. He also called for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe and many former Warsaw Pact members joined NATO during his presidency. Clinton's foreign policy in the Middle East saw him sign the Iraq Liberation Act which gave aid to groups against Saddam Hussein. He also participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nClinton's second term was dominated by the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which began in 1996, when he had a sexual relationship with 22-year-old Monica Lewinsky, an intern at the White House.

This scandal escalated throughout the year, culminating on December 19 when Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the second U.S. president\u2014the first since Andrew Johnson\u2014to be impeached. The two impeachment articles that the House passed were centered around him using the powers of the presidency to obstruct the investigation and lying under oath. In 1999, Clinton's impeachment trial began in the Senate. He was acquitted on both charges as the Senate failed to cast 67 votes against him, which was necessary to meet the two-thirds conviction threshold prescribed by Article I, section 3, clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nClinton left office in 2001 with the joint-highest approval rating of any U.S. president in the modern era, alongside Franklin D.

They were Ashok Kapur, who had previously worked as the national head for the ABN Amro Bank, Harkirat Singh, who had previously worked as the country head for the Deutsche Bank, and Rana Kapoor, who had previously worked as the head of corporate finance for the ANZ Grindlays Bank. The Rabobank in the Netherlands held the remaining 75% of the shares in the non-banking financial business. The three Indian promoters each owned 25% of the company. In 2003, it was rebranded as the Yes Bank. It was also the same year that Harkirat Singh resigned due to concerns over the influence exercised by Rabobank in the hiring of CEO and executive chairman positions.\n\nYes Bank has been unable to raise capital over the past few years, which has led to a steady deterioration in its financial position. This has resulted in potential loan losses, which in turn led to downgrades, which prompted investors to invoke bond covenants, and a withdrawal of deposits by customers. Over the course of the previous four quarters, the bank racked up losses and very little income. Rana Kapoor was fired as a result, and he was arrested in connection with a INR 466 crore money laundering case.\n\nThe bank's management, under the new leadership of Kumar, immediately repositioned itself and dealt with all internal and market related challenges to restore customer and depositor confidence. Under the coordinated efforts of the new board and management, Mehta assured shareholders of a speedy recovery, even as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and other banks lent it support through the historic Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme 2020.\n\nIn July 2020, Yes Bank Ltd closed their follow-on public offer (FPO) with 95% subscription, driven by institutional investors.\n\nAs of 28 July 2020, Yes Bank is an associate of State Bank of India which has a 30% stake in the company.\n\nOn 21 February 2023, Yes Bank issued 2,13,650 equity shares to its employees under the company ESOP plan.", "response": "Reserve Bank of India (RBI), State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "Based on the following passage what is alternating current affected by?", "context": "The movement of electric charge is known as an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.", "response": "Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance.

The organisation reports a worldwide membership of over 1.7 million, comprising soldiers, officers and adherents collectively known as Salvationists. Its founders sought to bring salvation to the poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their \"physical and spiritual needs\". It is present in 133 countries, running charity shops, operating shelters for the homeless and disaster relief, and humanitarian aid to developing countries.\n\nThe theology of the Salvation Army is derived from Methodism, although it is distinctive in institution and practice. A distinctive characteristic of the Salvation Army is its use of titles derived from military ranks, such as \"lieutenant\" or \"major\". It does not celebrate the rites of Baptism and Holy Communion. However, the Army's doctrine is aligned with the Wesleyan\u2013Arminian tradition, particularly the holiness movement. The Army's purposes are \"the advancement of the Christian religion... of education, the relief of poverty, and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole\".\n\nThe Army was founded in 1865 in London by one-time Methodist preacher William Booth and his wife Catherine as the East London Christian Mission, and can trace its origins to the Blind Beggar tavern. In 1878, Booth reorganised the mission, becoming its first General and introducing the military structure which has been retained as a matter of tradition. Its highest priority is its Christian principles. The current international leader of The Salvation Army and chief executive officer (CEO) is General Brian Peddle, who was elected by the High Council of The Salvation Army on 3 August 2018.\n\nIn 2011, Charity Watch rated the Salvation Army an \"A\u2212\" to an \"A\", indicating a high level of financial efficiency and organisational transparency. The Salvation Army has received an A-rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy.\n\nThe Salvation Army is one of the world's largest providers of social aid,[citation needed] with expenditures including operating costs of $2.6 billion in 2004, helping more than 32 million people in the U.S. alone. In addition to community centres and disaster relief, the organisation does work in refugee camps, especially among displaced people in Africa. In the United Kingdom, the Salvation Army is no longer the largest nongovernmental provider of social services; however, it still provides a significant service to people in need.

His film debut followed in 1982, with a minor role as an unnamed co-worker of Judge Reinhold's character in the coming-of-age film Fast Times at Ridgemont High, having originally auditioned for Reinhold's part. His experience on the film was marred by cast members endlessly quoting his uncle's films, which inspired him to change his name. Cage's first starring role came opposite Deborah Foreman in the romantic comedy Valley Girl (1983), in which he played a punk who falls in love with the titular valley girl, a plot loosely inspired by Romeo and Juliet. The film was a modest box office success and has been branded a cult classic. He auditioned for the role of Dallas Winston in his uncle's film The Outsiders, based on S.E. Hinton's novel, but lost to Matt Dillon. Cage, however, would co-star in Coppola's adaptation of another Hinton novel, Rumble Fish, in that year.\n\nIn 1984, Cage appeared in three period films, none of which fared well at the box office. In the drama, Racing with the Moon (1984), Cage featured opposite Sean Penn as friends who are awaiting deployment to the U.S. Marine Corps. Coppola's crime drama The Cotton Club saw him play a fictionalized version of mob hitman Vincent \"Mad Dog\" Coll, earning praise from critic Paul Attanasio for \"artully  his few moments to sketch a brawny, violent thug\". His final release of the year was Alan Parker's drama Birdy, in which he starred with Matthew Modine as two close friends and their trauma inflicted by serving in the Vietnam War. Cage lost weight for the role and had two of his front teeth pulled out to appear disfigured. Despite massively underperforming at the box office, the film, and Cage and Modine's performances, received positive reviews, with The New York Times critic Janet Maslin writing, \"Mr. Cage very sympathetically captures Al's urgency and frustration. Together, these actors work miracles with what might have been unplayable.\"\n\nIn 1986, Cage starred in the little-seen Canadian sports drama The Boy in Blue and his uncle's fantasy comedy Peggy Sue Got Married (1987) as the husband to Kathleen Turner's character, who has travelled back in time to their high school days. He then starred in the Coen brothers' crime comedy Raising Arizona (1987) as a dim-witted ex-con. Cage's biggest breakthrough came in 1987 with the romantic comedy Moonstruck, in which he starred alongside Cher as a hot-tempered baker who falls in love with his estranged brother's widowed fianc\u00e9.

Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.\nBy historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.\nThe process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction, and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.\nIn engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.\u200a If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.", "response": "The process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction.", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "What activities are popular among tourists visiting the Texas barrier islands?", "context": "The Texas barrier islands are a chain of barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico along the Texas Gulf Coast.

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.", "response": "Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish.

Meno begins the dialogue by asking Socrates whether virtue is taught, acquired by practice, or comes by nature. In order to determine whether virtue is teachable or not, Socrates tells Meno that they first need to determine what virtue is. When the characters speak of virtue, or rather arete, they refer to virtue in general, rather than particular virtues, such as justice or temperance. The first part of the work showcases Socratic dialectical style; Meno, unable to adequately define virtue, is reduced to confusion or aporia. Socrates suggests that they seek an adequate definition for virtue together. In response, Meno suggests that it is impossible to seek what one does not know, because one will be unable to determine whether one has found it.\n\nSocrates challenges Meno's argument, often called \"Meno's Paradox\" or the \"Learner's Paradox\", by introducing the theory of knowledge as recollection (anamnesis). As presented in the dialogue, the theory proposes that souls are immortal and know all things in a disembodied state; learning in the embodied is actually a process of recollecting that which the soul knew before it came into a body. Socrates demonstrates recollection in action by posing a mathematical puzzle to one of Meno's slaves. Subsequently, Socrates and Meno return to the question of whether virtue is teachable, employing the method of hypothesis. Near the end of the dialogue, Meno poses another famous puzzle, called \"The Meno Problem\" or \"The Value Problem for Knowledge\", which questions why knowledge is valued more highly than true belief. In response, Socrates provides a famous and somewhat enigmatic distinction between knowledge and true belief.", "response": "- arete: virtues in general, i.e. instead of a particular virtue\n- aporia: confusion\n- anamnesis: recollection of knowledge", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "What university did Ted Ringwood join and what discipline did he follow ?", "context": "Ted Ringwood was born in Kew, only child of Alfred Edward Ringwood.

In 2000, the Compulsory Education Act codified compulsory education for children of primary school age (excepting those with disabilities), and made it a criminal offence for parents to fail to enroll their children in school and ensure their regular attendance. Exemptions are allowed for homeschooling or full-time religious institutions, but parents must apply for exemption from the Ministry of Education and meet a minimum benchmark.\n\nThe main language of instruction in Singapore is English, which was officially designated the first language within the local education system in 1987. English is the first language learned by half the children by the time they reach preschool age and becomes the primary medium of instruction by the time they reach primary school. Although Malay, Mandarin and Tamil are also official languages, English is the language of instruction for nearly all subjects except the official Mother Tongue languages and the literatures of those languages; these are generally not taught in English, although there is provision for the use of English at the initial stages.

The Opel-RAK program and the spectacular public demonstrations of ground and air vehicles drew large crowds, as well as caused global public excitement as so-called \"Rocket Rumble\" and had a large long-lasting impact on later spaceflight pioneers like Wernher von Braun. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. The early era of space exploration was driven by a \"Space Race\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971.

Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the Greek word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.\nFurther work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re in 1819\u20131820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in 1861 and 1862.\u200a\nWhile the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, \u00c1nyos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.", "response": "Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers.

The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Sea of Crete and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin, featuring thousands of islands. The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions, and has a population of approximately 10.5 million. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki and Patras.\n\nGreece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, being the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, theatre and the Olympic Games. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as poleis (singular polis), which spanned the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to the North Western parts of India. The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek culture and influence in antiquity. Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the Byzantine Empire, which was culturally and linguistically predominantly Greek. The Greek Orthodox Church, which emerged in the first century AD, helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox world. After falling under Ottoman rule in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern nation state in 1830 following a war of independence. Over the first hundred years the kingdom of Greece sought its territorial expansion, which was mainly achieved in the early 20th century, during the Balkan Wars and up until the catastrophe of Greece's Asia Minor Campaign in 1922. The short-lived republic that followed, beset by the ramifications of civil strife, came to an end in 1936, when the imposition of a royalist dictatorship inaugurated a long period of authoritarian rule, marked by military occupation during World War II, civil war and military dictatorship. Greece achieved record economic growth from 1950 through the 1970s, allowing it to join the ranks of developed nations.

The content provider provides the content in a variety of formats - including film, tape, CD, DVD, hard disks and digital files.\n\nCapture\nIf the content provided by the content provider is not already in a digital format, it must first be converted to a digital format. In the case of film or tape, this is often called the \u201ccapture\u201d process in which hardware will play back the original medium and \u201ccapture\u201d its contents and convert it into a digital format. This captured file is often captured at the highest feasible quality as it is expected to undergo various processes that could degrade the quality. Therefore, the highest possible capture is always desired.\n\nCompression\nThe captured digital file is often extremely large, requiring a large amount of digital storage space and impossible to deliver to the consumer via broadband methods. Therefore, it must be compressed in a process called encoding or transcoding.\n\nIn this process, a codec is used to compress the captured digital file into a format which is small enough to be delivered to the end-user, usually via broadband methods. This encoding process entails consideration of many variables as to how the file is to be compressed. For audio, this usually consists of bit-rate and sample rate. Additional variables for video include resolution, frame rate and also has its own bit-rate that needs to be specified.\n\nThese variables are determined by how a particular file is to be consumed; download, streaming to a PC, streaming to a mobile device, etc.\n\nQuality, however, often becomes an issue at this stage and great care is taken to ensure the quality of the medium is of the highest possible quality for its intended deliver method. For example, a video encoded for streaming to mobile devices requires a much higher level of compression than would for a PC download, so the quality of the video will not be nearly as good.\n\nQuality Control\nQuality control is required to ensure that a file that has been encoded properly, with desired results and free of corruption. The degree to which a file is considered acceptable is based either on the discretion of the party charged with encoding the content, or a specific standard defined by the content owner for which the encoding party must comply.\n\nQuality control need not only take place at this juncture. Most companies dealing with the digital supply chain process will subject the media to scrutiny of the quality control process at various stages including: original capture, post-compression, post-ingest and post-publish, thus ensuring the media has not become corrupt or has not been degraded undesirably during any stage along the digital supply chain process.\n\nDigital Asset Management\nThe digital asset management system handles the metadata, content and their related assets such as album cover and movie poster art. It is often the digital asset management systems which also handles the publishing of the content itself to a digital storefront. Some digital asset management systems specifically built for the digital supply chain and the delivery of electronic media will track the progress of content as it goes through the digital supply chain. A good digital asset management system should also include reporting tools which can report back on the status of various aspects of the digital supply chain itself.\n\nMetadata Entry\nMetadata is the information that identifies and describes the contents of a medium. This information can include media-specific information such as: Title, artist(s), production company, seasonal/episodic description, original release date, etc. Metadata can also include business-related information such as: pricing and availability.\n\nDigital Rights Management\nAn important aspect of the digital supply chain is the process of encrypting the content so that it cannot be played back without the proper license which is often acquired via purchase of content or subscription. This reduces the possibility of media being pirated.\n\nIngest\nIngest is the stage in which the compressed file and metadata are put into the digital asset management system. It is not necessary for the metadata and the compressed media file to be ingested into the system at the same time, however, there will be a point in the process in which both have been ingested into the system and the metadata can reference the media file.\n\nContent Delivery Network\nWhen media files are ingested they are hosted and delivered from a content delivery network (CDN) capable of delivering the media to the end-user. The CDN should be able to support the expected number of consumers.\n\nMerchant/Storefront/Digital Retailer/Digital Service Provider\nThe content will ultimately display on a digital storefront where the consumer can view a catalog listing of the content and access the content via purchase, subscription or other method a merchant has elected to make the content available.", "response": "Content Provider, Capture, Compression, Quality Control, Digital Asset Management, Metadata, Entry, Digital Rights Management, Ingest, Content Delivery Network, Merchant/Storefront/Digital, Retailer/Digital Service Provider", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "Extract universities Moret studied at and his year of graduation for each, and put them in a bulleted list.", "context": "Moret was born in 1953 in Vevey Switzerland, and did his undergraduate studies at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), graduating in 1975.

The film also features Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, and Bill Paxton.\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster.

List the results in comma separated format.", "context": "Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The best-known types are patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. The modern concept of intellectual property developed in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. The term \"intellectual property\" began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in most of the world's legal systems.\n\nThe main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to benefit from the information and intellectual goods they create, and allows them to protect their ideas and prevent copying. These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.\n\nThe intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is \"indivisible\", since an unlimited number of people can \"consume\" an intellectual good without its being depleted.Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from appropriation problems: Landowners can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but producers of information or literature can usually do little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.", "response": "patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets", "category": "information_extraction"}, {"instruction": "List all the important milestone in chronological order", "context": "Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors.

Of the two, Java is the faster language, but Python is simpler and easier to learn. Each is well-established, platform-independent, and part of a large, supportive community. But that is where the similarities end. When you\u2019re considering Python versus Java, each language has different uses for different purposes, and each has pros and cons to consider.\n\nAdvantages of Java\n\nSpeed and efficiency are two of the big draws of using Java. It's also one of the coding languages considered to be easy to learn. Because many of the processes of this high-level language run automatically, you won't have to do an intense study of how everything works as much as you would with a low-level language. You should be able to master it relatively quickly depending on how much time you can devote to learning and practicing. Other advantages of using Java include the following:\n\n(1) It's simple: The syntax is straightforward, making it easy to write. It's not as complex as languages like C++, and it uses automatic memory allocation.\n\n(2) It\u2019s platform independent: You can use Java on multiple types of computers, including Windows, iOS, Unix, and Linux systems, as long as it has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform.\n\n(3) It\u2019s object oriented: Because you create classes containing data and functions and objects that belong to those classes, it offers a more intuitive approach for big project development. It also provides flexibility and easier troubleshooting, and the ability to reuse the code.\n\n(4) It has a large global community: This is helpful when you're learning Java or should you run into any problems.\n\n(5) It supports multithreading: When you use Java, you can run more than one thread at a time. When running multiple threads, they share a common memory area to increase efficiency and performance.\n\n(6) It\u2019s secure: Java avoids using explicit pointers, runs inside a virtual machine called a sandbox, uses byte-code verifier to check for illegal code, and provides library-level safety along with Java security package and run-time security checks. \n\nDisadvantages of Java\n\nBefore deciding whether Java is the right programming language for you to start with, it\u2019s essential to consider its weaknesses. One of the main downsides to using Java is that it uses a large amount of memory\u2014considerably more than Python.\n\nAdditionally, Java manages its memory through garbage collection, which happens once the application you\u2019re working on no longer references the object. Java\u2019s garbage collector clears it from memory, but during the process, other threads have to stop while the garbage collector works. The step impacts the overall performance of the application. Other disadvantages include:\n\n(1) It doesn\u2019t offer control over garbage collection: As a programmer, you won\u2019t have the ability to control garbage collection using functions like free() or delete().\n\n(2) It has a lot of words: Although Java is simple, it does tend to have a lot of words in it, which will often leave you with complex, lengthy sentences and explanations.\n\n(3) It doesn't have a native look when you use it for desktops: Java has multiple graphical user interface (GUI) builders, but they aren't the best if you're creating complex UI on a desktop. Java is weaker when you're using it for desktop versus mobile when it comes to user experience and user interface. While there are many GUI builders to choose from, you'll need to do a lot of research to find the right one for your project.\n\n\nPython: The simple path\n\nAlthough Java is faster, Python is more versatile, easier to read, and has a simpler syntax. According to Stack Overflow, this general use, interpreted language is the fourth most popular coding language.  It's also one of the most in-demand programming languages that hiring managers look for when hiring candidates, according to HackerRank, second only to JavaScript. \n\nPython's popularity has experienced explosive growth in the past few years, with more than 11.3 million coders choosing to use it, mainly for IoT, data science, and machine learning applications, according to ZDNet. Further, Python has had a 25 percent growth rate, adding 2.3 million developers to its community between Q3 2020 and Q3 2021, according to SlashData's \u201cState of the Developer Nation.\u201d.\n\nAdvantages of Python\n\nPython\u2019s versatility is difficult to match, and it's so flexible that it encourages experimentation. This keeps programmers from being pigeonholed into only building one type of application. You can learn just one language and use it to make new and different things.\n\nComputer Weekly calls Python the most versatile programming language, noting that \u201cAlthough there might be a better solution for any given problem, Python will always get the job done well\u201d. Other advantages of Python include:\n\n(1) It\u2019s platform-independent: Like Java, you can use Python on various platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux. You\u2019ll just need an interpreter designed for that platform.\n\n(2) It allows for fast development: Because Python is dynamically typed, it's fast and friendly for development. Additionally, it uses asynchronous code to tackle situations and challenges faster because each unit of code runs separately.\n\n(3) It offers extensive libraries: Its large library supports common tasks and commands. It also contains code that can be used for many different purposes, ranging from generating documentation to unit testing to CGI.\n\n(4) It offers a more flexible approach to programming: Python supports a variety of programming styles and has multiple paradigms. Not only is this optimal for programmers who enjoy flexibility, but it also makes it ideal for start-ups that might need to shift approaches abruptly.\n\n(5) It's free and open-source: You can download Python without any cost, and because it's so easy to learn and boasts one of the largest and most active communities\u2014you should be able to start writing code in mere minutes.\n\n(6) It may boost productivity: NetGuru says that Python is more productive than Java because of how concise it is and because it's dynamically typed. Additionally, it has control capabilities and integration features that can make applications more productive.\n\nDisadvantages of Python\n\nWhile Python is arguably one of the easiest and fastest languages to learn, it\u2019s also decidedly slower to execute because it\u2019s a dynamically typed, interpreted language, executed line-by-line. Python does extra work while executing the code, making it less suitable for use in projects that depend on speed. However, if speed isn\u2019t a sensitive issue, Python\u2019s slower nature won\u2019t likely be a problem.\n\nOther potential disadvantages include:\n\n(1) It only executes one thread at a time: Python has a Global Interpreter Lock that only lets one thread execute at a time, so if you're working on a multi-threaded CPU-bound program, it'll likely be even slower. Using multiprocessing programs instead of multithreaded programs can be an effective workaround.\n\n(2) It isn't mobile native: Python can be effectively and easily used for mobile purposes, but you'll need to put a bit more effort into finding libraries that give you the necessary framework. Some examples include Kivy, which lets you use the same API to create mobile apps and software that you can run on Raspberry PI, Linux, and Windows.\n\n(3) It uses a large amount of memory: If you're working on a project where many objects are active in RAM, this could present an issue for you. Switching to NumPy could be an effective workaround to reduce the amount of memory Python uses for each object.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is room temperature?", "context": "", "response": "Room temperature is a range of air temperatures that most people prefer for indoor settings.

We have raised puppies from our dogs and given them away to friends and neighbors.  Dogs provide a lot of love and companionship to everyone in the family and they can be as beloved as any human.  Dogs take a great deal to care for because they are completely dependent on humans to keep them alive.  A dog left out in the wild is unlikely to survive without help from a caring human.  Dogs must be fed, watered, walked for exercise, socialized with other dogs and with other people as well so that they feel safe and interact safely with others.  Dogs can live to between 10 and 15 years old on average so they are with a family for a long time.  Dogs come in all shapes, sizes, colors, skills and are often referred to as breeds.  Breeds have different characteristics and people sometimes select a dog for the breed.

The Buddhist concept of Karma is a natural process that operates with all our volitional actions and which does not need an external agency or power that sits in judgement.\n\nKarma in Buddhism should not be considered as moral justice, or a method of reward and punishment, that needs an external body or authority to decide whom or what should be punished and rewarded. It is believed that Gautama Buddha attained complete insight into how the process of Karma works during the night of his full enlightenment when, through the divine eye (dibbacakku), Buddha saw how other beings die and are reborn in happy and unhappy states according to their Karma.\n\nAccording to the Cula-kammavibhanga sutta of the Majima Nikava (collection of the middle length discourses of the Buddha), a young brahmin by the name of Subha had approached the Buddha and inquired as to why there was so much inequality among human beings in terms of being short-lived or long-lived, sickly or healthy, ugly or beautiful, powerful or powerless, poor or rich, low-born or high-born, ignorant or intelligent, etc. Buddha had then explained that:\n\"all living beings are the owners of their actions, heirs to their actions, they originate from their actions, they are related through their actions, they have their actions as their refuge and that it is action or Karma that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior\n\nThe word Karma in Pali, and karma in Sanskrit, means action but encompasses only actions that are intentional, volitional and willful and which will lead to consequences sooner or later. The mind (citta) by itself cannot perform or direct any mental, verbal or physical action and it is the intention, will, mental effort or volition (cetana) that directs any mental, verbal or physical action.\n\nThus the Buddha declared:\n\"Cetanaham bhikkhave kammam vadami\nCetayitva kammam karoti, kayena, vacaya, manasa\"\n\n\"It is volition that I call Karma, by volition one performs Karma through body, word or mind.\"", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Give me a summary about St Paul's Cathedral", "context": "", "response": "St Paul's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in London and is the seat of the Bishop of London.

Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present structure, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the city after the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral (Old St Paul's Cathedral), largely destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St Paul's Churchyard, being the site of St Paul's Cross.\n\nThe cathedral is one of the most famous and recognisable sights of London. Its dome, surrounded by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At 365 ft (111 m) high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963.

First figure out your travel arrangements.  If you are able to drive, you will have your own vehicle available to travel to the parks.  If you fly, you will either need a rental car or will need to use other forms of transportation, such as uber or lyft.  Within the Walt Disney World parks and resorts there is Disney provided transportation, but it is often crowded during peak hours such as park opening and closing.  Next you will need to decide where to stay.  The Walt Disney World resorts are the most convenient, but also the most expensive option.  There are Walt Disney World resorts cater to different economic levels from more affordable up to more luxurious.  Staying on the grounds will also often allow to enter parks earlier or stay later than the general public.  Staying off the grounds is usually less expensive.  There are many hotels and resorts in the Orlando area to choose from.  Other options are to use a rental service such as VRBO or AirBnB to rent a property such as a house or condo for your stay.  Next you need to decide on how many days in the parks you'll spend and whether you will stay in one park for an entire day or want to have the option to \"park hop\".  Tickets are discounted for a larger number of days in the park.  The \"park hopper\" option is a premium on top of the base ticket price.  Often there are discount ticket websites but be careful about scams.  The safest is to buy from Disney or a licensed travel advisor.  Typically the price from a travel advisor is they same as buying from Disney.  Next make a budget for how much you'll spend on food in the parks.  Food is fairly pricy, but there are options from counter service all the way up to sit down restaurants and fine dining.  Realize that eating in a sit down restaurant will take time away from other activities in the parks.  Reservations can be made on the Disney website but are often difficult to get for some restaurants.  Taking food into the park is also an option as there are lockers available at the parks to store things.  Some items such as knives are not allowed, so plan ahead if food needs to be sliced.  Next look at the rides and attractions that your family wants to ride and make a plan for which are the most important.  A guidebook such as the Unauthorized Guide to Disney World is very helpful to provide plans for your day(s) in the parks.  These guidebooks will give you help on when the lines for attractions will be shorter.  Don't just try to show up in a park without some sort of plan as to which attractions to visit and when.  Visiting without a plan will result in frustration, long waits, and disappointment.  Also realize that you will not be able to visit all of the park attractions in one visit.  As the time of your visit approaches watch the weather reports.  Late afternoon thunderstorms are typical in Orlando in the summertime.  Most attractions at Disney World are indoors and will continue operating during rain.  Rain ponchos can be purchased in the park, but they are more expensive in park than if you bring your own.  It can also be very hot during the summer, so plan on having water, sunscreen and wearing appropriate clothing for the weather.  Be aware of how your party's attitude is during your visit.  Visiting Disney World requires a lot of walking and also requires stamina.  If people are getting tired, take a break, either in the park or back at your hotel.  Don't make your visit a \"death march\".  Also base the length of your stay in the park on the age of people in your party.  Young children or elderly may require longer and more frequent breaks.  One option is to go to the park in the morning, go back to your hotel in the afternoon for a dip in the pool, and return to the park later afternoon or evening.  Pay attention to the park hours to know how early you can arrive and how late you can stay.  Most parks have some sort of parade and fireworks show at closing.  Most are very worthwhile to see.  And remember above all that you should have fun.  Don't be so focused on your plan of visiting attractions that you don't take advantage of spur of the moment opportunities such as interacting with characters or getting a quick photo with the family.  Hopefully this will not be your only vacation at Disney World, and you want to have fond memories of your visit so that you will want to return again as soon as possible.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "When is the World Teacher's Day celebrated?", "context": "", "response": "World Teacher's Day is celebrated on 5th October", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Name a very famous family of composers & musicians of late baroque", "context": "", "response": "Bach family gave to the world few famous composers - Johann Sebastian Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Johann Christian Bach and others", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Are Rainbow Trout and Steelhead the same?", "context": "", "response": "Steelhead and Rainbow trout are the same species, but have different lifestyles.

If you are a parent choosing between the two, multiple factors need to be taken into consideration.\nThe first factor is the availability of a robotics program in your area.  While you can form an independent team that is not affiliated with your school or another organization, it will require a significant financial and time investment.  At the high school level teams typically design their robots with CAD software and must machine the parts themselves.  Teams often consist of 20 or more members so that all of the aspects of the competition can be covered, such as creating and assembling the hardware, electrical wiring, systems design, programming and documenting the engineering process.  All of the parts and equipment need to be purchased and maintained, and members put in a lot of hours during the competition season.  Joining a pre-existing team that already has equipment, members and mentors familiar with a program will make it easiest for a child to participate, regardless of which competition the team is a part of.\nIf both VEX and FIRST programs are available, then it depends on how intense of an experience the child is interested in.  The VEX competition has a lower barrier to entry because it requires smaller robots.  Two pairs of robots compete against each other in a match to see which pair can get more points.  While teams will need to machine some parts and must have skills in electrical and software design, a team can be smaller and still compete effectively.  The FIRST competition involves much larger and more complex robots and challenges.  Two alliances of three robots each compete against each other in a match, with a total of six robots on the field at once.  Teams need to have more members to effectively compete, and participants need more in-depth training on hardware, electrical, system and software design.  There is also a business requirement, where teams have to create a marketing banner, brochure and video for their team to submit as part of the competition.\nWhether you choose VEX or FIRST, a child in high school that participates in a well-run robotics program will gain valuable engineering and organizational experience that will serve them well, both on a college application and after graduation.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "what is the capital of China?", "context": "", "response": "The capital of China is Beijing.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "How is plastic made?", "context": "", "response": "Plastic is made from oil, natural gas and even plant oils during refining of these oils into other products like gasoline.

GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.\n\nWhen applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If there is significant statistical evidence that one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease.\n\nGWA studies investigate the entire genome, in contrast to methods that specifically test a small number of pre-specified genetic regions. Hence, GWAS is a non-candidate-driven approach, in contrast to gene-specific candidate-driven studies. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants in DNA associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal.\n\nThe first successful GWAS published in 2002 studied myocardial infarction.

Home chargers tend to be slow chargers which reach around 3.6 - 7 kW, although you can also charge using your home\u2019s plug sockets which charge at speeds of around 2.3 kW. \n\nPros\nCharging your Tesla Model Y at home overnight is probably the cheapest, most cost-efficient way to charge your EV. This is because off-peak energy prices are significantly cheaper than peak charging. Model Ys come with an adapter wire, allowing you to charge your EV using your home's plugs easily. \n\nIf you're interested in charging at home, installing a home charging unit could be worth your time. Over time this could save you money. There are grants available to help you afford a home charger. \n\nThe OZEV Chargepoint Grant is up to \u00a3350 or 75% off the fully installed charge point cost if specifics are met. There is also the Scottish EST Domestic Chargepoint Grant which gives you up to \u00a3300 and can be used alongside the OZEV Chargepoint Grant.\n\nCons\nHome chargers rarely exceed speeds of 7 kW. This means charging the Tesla Model Y's large battery would take a long time. If you don't invest in a home charging station, it might also be risky to home charge as the 3-pin plug can damage your home's wiring. \n\nIf you choose to charge during the day, it can also get quite expensive and may not compare favourably with public charging stations, despite being much slower.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What does BAFTA stands for ?", "context": "", "response": "British Academy of Film and Television Arts", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What are a few dishes you can cook with potatoes?", "context": "", "response": "There are a lot of great dishes you can cook with potatoes.

The precise function of palmitoylation depends on the particular protein being considered. Palmitoylation enhances the hydrophobicity of proteins and contributes to their membrane association. Palmitoylation also appears to play a significant role in subcellular trafficking of proteins between membrane compartments, as well as in modulating protein\u2013protein interactions. In contrast to prenylation and myristoylation, palmitoylation is usually reversible (because the bond between palmitic acid and protein is often a thioester bond). The reverse reaction in mammalian cells is catalyzed by acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs) in the cytosol and palmitoyl protein thioesterases in lysosomes. Because palmitoylation is a dynamic, post-translational process, it is believed to be employed by the cell to alter the subcellular localization, protein\u2013protein interactions, or binding capacities of a protein.\n\nAn example of a protein that undergoes palmitoylation is hemagglutinin, a membrane glycoprotein used by influenza to attach to host cell receptors. The palmitoylation cycles of a wide array of enzymes have been characterized in the past few years, including H-Ras, Gs\u03b1, the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In signal transduction via G protein, palmitoylation of the \u03b1 subunit, prenylation of the \u03b3 subunit, and myristoylation is involved in tethering the G protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane so that the G protein can interact with its receptor.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What does Neolithic mean?", "context": "", "response": "\"Neolithic\" comes from the Greek word for \"new stone,\" and it started about 10,000 years after the Upper Paleolithic.

In 1953 Francis Crick, James Watson, Rosalind Franklin, and colleagues, working at Medical Research Council unit, Cavendish laboratory, Cambridge (now the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology), made a double helix model of DNA which changed the entire research scenario. They proposed the DNA structure based on previous research done by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This research then lead to finding DNA material in other microorganisms, plants and animals.\n\nMolecular biology is not simply the study of biological molecules and their interactions; rather, it is also a collection of techniques developed since the field's genesis which have enabled scientists to learn about molecular processes. In this way it has both complemented and improved biochemistry and genetics as methods (of understanding nature) that began before its advent. One notable technique which has revolutionized the field is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was developed in 1983. PCR is a reaction which amplifies small quantities of DNA, and it is used in many applications across scientific disciplines.\n\nThe central dogma of molecular biology describes the process in which DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into protein.\n\nMolecular biology also plays a critical role in the understanding of structures, functions, and internal controls within individual cells, all of which can be used to efficiently target new drugs, diagnose disease, and better understand cell physiology.

However middle eastern music is based on different scale systems. It has quarter notes in addition and various regions have a different number of notes in their octave system.\n\nWestern music has harmony (ie. chords) while middle eastern music does not. In middle eastern music, there is only one melodic line with rise and fall. So the purity of the melodic line and the complexity of the rhythm is what make two different songs apart.
