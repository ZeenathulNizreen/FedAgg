Outside of hockey, he supports the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball and threw out the ceremonial first pitch at a Blue Jays game in 2016.\nOn June 21, 2017, Electronic Arts revealed that McDavid would be the cover athlete for NHL 18, their annual installment of the NHL video game series. Additionally, McDavid's unique skating style inspired the Real Player Motion technology used in NHL 19, in which player size and other attributes affect their skating speed and power. In 2022, McDavid was one of several Canadian athletes to appear on boxes of Cheerios cereal as part of their \"Be the Cheer\" promotion, in which customers could write personalized messages to athletes competing at the Olympic Games. That same year, McDavid became the first active professional athlete to serve as a brand ambassador for sports betting company BetMGM.\n\nCale Makar\nMakar is the son of Gary Makar and Laura MacGregor. He was named after former NHL player Cale Hulse. His younger brother Taylor plays at UMass-Amherst, which Cale also attended, and was also drafted by the Avalanche in the seventh round of the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. Makar's cousin Mark Logan also played collegiate hockey from 2015 to 2019 at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Tom Lysiak was his father's cousin. He is of Ukrainian descent on his father's side. Growing up, he was a fan of the hometown Calgary Flames.\n\nAuston Matthews\nMatthews comes from a family of athletes, with his father having played college baseball and with an uncle, Wes Matthews, who briefly played in the National Football League for the Miami Dolphins. His father is the chief technology officer of a manufacturing company based in New Jersey. He has two sisters: Alexandria, who is three years older, and Breyana, who is five years younger. Due to his mother's Mexican ancestry, Matthews can speak some Spanish.\n\nOff the ice, Matthews was enrolled in several online courses with the University of Nebraska Omaha. In late August 2016, he moved to Toronto and began working out with teammates Mitch Marner and Morgan Rielly. Matthews' favorite athlete growing up was Kobe Bryant, while his favorite sports movie is The Mighty Ducks. He is a fan of players Jonathan Toews and An\u017ee Kopitar due to their all around offensive and defensive game, has had his playing style compared to them. In recognition of Matthews' four-goal NHL debut, rap artist SVDVM released a song titled \"Auston Matthews\". At the 2019 NHL Awards, Matthews was named the cover athlete for EA Sports' ice hockey video game NHL 20.", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "What are some good items to keep in your pantry if you want to cook Asian food?", "context": "", "response": "Pantry items that are commonly used in eastern Asian cuisine are Soy Sauce, Fish Sauce, Oyster Sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, rice cooking wine (mirin), rice, and MSG.", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "What are all the ways I can get around in San Francisco?", "context": "", "response": "In San Francisco, there are four main ways to get around the city.

Dogs can bark for few reasons. Perhaps they want your attention, or they might be fearful or anxious and are barking to alert you. Also, barking habits can also be very breed specific. Some breeds are known to be more vocal than other breeds. It's important to try and understand why they are barking to then initiate the proper course of action to address their barking habits. If you believe they are barking for attention, one idea is to make sure you are not rewarding their barking by distracting them with a treat or playtime. By doing this, you are teaching them that if they bark, the dog will get what they want. Instead, you might want to consider a couple items. First, is the dog getting enough exercise or releasing their energy. Increase their stimulation by walking them more, playing with them, or socializing them with other dogs or humans. This added stimulation may reduce their need for attention. If they are barking because they are fearful or anxious, think about what is happening or what the environment is that may be cause their fear or anxiety. Then, try and change the environment or situation so the dog feels safe. One action that may help is providing a safe place for your dog, such as a dog crate or dog bed, so they know exactly what to do when they are afraid or anxious.

While a country's population is a good identifier for the total selection pool for high performing athletes to come from, it is one of many factors. A country's founding history, climate zone, and GDP are other notable factors in sport performance. \n\nA nations history plays factor as many sports are baked in centuries of tradition. For example, Cricket, which is believed to have originated in England is most popular in countries that were originally British Colonies. Long traditions such as this set specific sports into the culture of a nation, increasing the percentage of the athlete pool that it can pull from and can increase the level at which that nation is competitive. \n\nClimate zone can also influence the competitiveness of a country in given sports. Norway, fore example, earned the most olympic medals of any country in the 2022 olympic games with a total of 37 medals. In the summer games of 2020 (held in 2021), Norway ranked 20th overall with just 8 medals. Norways Climate and Topography have led winter sports to be extremely popular, and Norway has over time developed elite programs in cross country/nordic skiing, speed skating, curling, biathlon, and ski jumping. \n\nA nations wealth will also influence performance in sport at the international level. This occurs predominantly for two reasons. First is that more money enables larger budgets on equipment, coaching, player development, participation in international circuits, data insights, medical staff etc. that over time create a performance separation from those who can not afford these things. Second is access to sports, many sports are quite expensive some examples include snow sports, gymnastics, swimming, hockey, and polo.

There are several examples of this in other countries throughout history. That being said, there are just as many examples of countries indicting former presidents without any sign of abuse. In fact, it can be an important part of the \"checks and balances\" of a democracy (see France, South Korea, etc.) One of the factors you can look at when determining if the justice system is being abused or not is the number of cases/indictments being brought against the former head of government.

By train - Traveling by train is another common way to get from Munich to Rome. While it will take longer than by air, tickets are very inexpensive and can be purchased the day of travel. A one way train ticket from Munich to Rome will cost roughly $35 (32 Euros), and take between 9-12 hours, depending on the route and number of stops.\n\n3. By car - Traveling by car from Munich to Rome is also an option. With limited stops, it will take roughly 10 hours to drive from Munich to Rome, but having a car will allow you flexibility to stop along the way at any cities or sites that you want to see. \n\nDepending on your specific needs, all three of these options could be viable ways to travel from Munich to Rome.", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "What is the best wideangle lens for sony apec camera", "context": "", "response": "Sigma DC DN 16MM 1.4 .

Find the puncture\nUsing the valve as your starting point, closely inspect the tread of the tyre to \ufb01nd the cause of the puncture.\nPay close attention to the sidewalls (the non-treaded portion on the side of the tyre where the pressure and size information is printed/moulded) to make sure there are no tears or holes.\nRemove any glass, grit or other debris that you spot. A small flat-head screwdriver or awl is the best tool for this, but be careful not to dig too deep. A small set of pliers can also be useful for removing embedded thorns.\nEven if you \ufb01nd one possible cause of the puncture, continue checking the tyre thoroughly until you get back to the valve because there could well be more.\n\nStep 2. Remove the inner tube\nLet the air out of the inner tube and push the valve up into the tyre, unscrewing and retaining the valve lockring if \ufb01tted.\nOn the side of the wheel opposite the valve, slip a tyre lever under the tyre\u2019s bead and a further tyre lever about roughly 5cm away.\nPull the nearer tyre lever towards you, lifting the tyre\u2019s bead over the edge of the rim. Continue until one bead of the tyre is completely free of the rim then pull the tube out.\nRemove the tyre completely from the rim \u2013 with most tyres this can be done by hand unless they are exceptionally tight.\n\nStep 3. Locate the puncture on the inner tube\nIf you are just going to replace the inner tube, move to step 6.\nIf you want to patch the inner tube \u2013 and you ought to, it\u2019s not that hard! \u2013 in\ufb02ate the tube and listen for air escaping.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to find the hole by listening alone, try passing your lips over the top of the tube.\nIf the hole still can\u2019t be found, re-in\ufb02ate the tube and pass it through a bowl of water, or rub the tube down with soapy water, until you spot escaping bubbles. Be sure to dry the tube before proceeding to the next step.\n\nStep 4. Prepare the inner tube for patching\nSelect an appropriately sized patch \u2013 if in doubt, err on the side of caution and use a bigger rather than smaller patch.\nRoughen the surface of the tube around the hole with sandpaper (usually included with any good puncture repair kit).\nEnsure that any moulding marks on the tube are completely flattened down because these can cause issues when glueing. Thoroughly brush off any rubber \u2018shavings\u2019. Cleanliness is key when repairing a puncture.\nIf you\u2019re using pre-glued patches \u2013 such as Park\u2019s popular GP-2 patch kit \u2013 you can now patch the hole. Thoroughly press down on the patch to ensure it\u2019s fully in contact with the tube.\nIf you\u2019re using a \u2018traditional\u2019 glue-on patch kit, start by applying a generous drop of glue \u2013 or rubber cement by its proper name \u2013 to the tube and spread this across an area slightly larger than the patch you intend to use. Allow this to dry.\nSimilarly, apply a second, thinner layer. Once again, allow to dry \u2013 when the glue is dry, its surface will change from a shiny to a matte finish.\nThe key to ensuring a good long-lasting puncture repair is patience, so don\u2019t rush this step.\n\nStep 5. Patching an inner tube\nFirmly press the patch into place after removing the backing foil \u2013 cleanliness is also key to a good repair, so leave removing the foil until the very last moment.\nIf there\u2019s a thin cellophane backing on the patch, it can be left on. It\u2019s good practice to dust any stray glue with chalk, talcum powder or fine road dust to prevent it from sticking to the inside of the tyre casing.\n\nStep 6. Inspect the tyre casing and rim tape\nBefore refitting the tube, thoroughly double/triple-check the inside of the tyre casing \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more frustrating than going to the effort of patching a tube only to puncture it again with a stray thorn you may have missed.\nIt\u2019s also good practice to check the rim tape. If a hard plastic rim strip \u2013 often found on cheaper bikes \u2013 is torn, it leaves a sharp edge that can easily slice a tube.\nLikewise, if your rim tape has slipped, it can leave eyelets or spoke holes exposed, which can also puncture a tube.\nIf you have persistent problems with your rim tape puncturing your tube, try swapping it out for new tape tape \n\n\nStep 7. Refit the tyre\nAfter repairing the tube and thoroughly checking the tyre, re\ufb01t one side of the tyre \u2013 one bead, to use the correct term \u2013 to the rim.\nSlightly in\ufb02ate the tube (just enough to give it structure) and re\ufb01t it to the wheel, putting the valve through its hole first.\nStarting at the opposite side of the rim to the valve, use your thumbs to lift the tyre\u2019s bead over the rim. Work your way around the rim until there\u2019s just one small section of the tyre left.\nPush the valve up into the tyre and then, using your thumbs, ease the remaining section of the tyre\u2019s bead over the edge of the rim.\nIf the tyre is particularly tight, avoid the temptation to use a tyre lever to push the last section of the tyre onto the rim \u2013 you\u2019ll almost certainly pinch your inner tube doing so.\nIf you\u2019re struggling to pop the tyre onto the wheel, try putting the tyre on the ground, holding it in place with your feet and rolling the bead back toward you \u2013 heavy gloves really help here. This takes a little practice but should work with even the most stubborn tyres.\n\n\nStep 8. Check the repair and inflate the tyre\nCheck that the tube isn\u2019t trapped between the rim and the tyre bead by working your way around the tyre, pushing the bead into the well of the rim.\nIf the tube is trapped, try \u2018massaging\u2019 the tyre to encourage it to seat properly. Pumping it up a small amount may also help to seat the tube properly.\nIn\ufb02ate the tyre to a point where it feels soft but has maintained its shape. Then check that the moulding mark around the tyre follows the rim evenly all the way around.\nIf not, de\ufb02ate a little and ease any high spots down and pull low spots up until the bead is \ufb01tted evenly.\nIn\ufb02ate fully and check once again that the tyre\u2019s bead is still seated evenly and that the tyre isn\u2019t lifting off the rim at any point, then adjust your pressures to suit.", "category": "brainstorming"}, {"instruction": "I'm looking to learn a new programming language.

It is an important branch in biology because heredity is vital to organisms' evolution. Gregor Mendel, a Moravian Augustinian friar working in the 19th century in Brno, was the first to study genetics scientifically. Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring over time. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene.\n\nTrait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has expanded to study the function and behavior of genes. Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the context of the cell, the organism (e.g. dominance), and within the context of a population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including molecular genetics, epigenetics and population genetics. Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life (archaea, bacteria, and eukarya).\n\nGenetic processes work in combination with an organism's environment and experiences to influence development and behavior, often referred to as nature versus nurture. The intracellular or extracellular environment of a living cell or organism may increase or decrease gene transcription. A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate (lacking sufficient waterfall or rain). While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal, the one in the arid climate only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Classify which colors are shades or red or purple: Violet, burgundy, lavender, brick, lilac, plum, rust, orchid, maroon, ruby, cardinal, fire-engine", "context": "", "response": "Red: Burgundy, brick, rust, maroon, ruby, cardinal, fire-engine\nPurple: Violet, lavender, lilac, plum, orchid", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which instrument is string or percussion: Kemanek, Buzuq", "context": "", "response": "Buzuq is string, Kemanek is percussion.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which instrument is string or woodwind: Asor, Aulochrome", "context": "", "response": "Aulochrome is woodwind, Asor is string.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Classify these as a synthetic or natural fiber", "context": "", "response": "wool, polyester, cotton, silk, nylon, aramid, jute", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Which of the following historical figures are known for their contribution to music: Mozart, George Washington, Vincent Van Gogh, Golda Meir, and Billy Holiday?", "context": "", "response": "Mozart and Billy Holiday are known for music.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Who is the rbr formula 1 team principal?", "context": "", "response": "The Red Bull Racing team principal is Christian Horner", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Classify each of the following as edible or not edible: hamburger, toast, rubber, leather, pizza, plastic", "context": "", "response": "Hamburger: Edible\nToast: Edible\nRubber: Not Edible\nLeather: Not Edible\nPizza: Edible\nPlastic: Not Edible", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "If you were to weigh each one of these items on average, what would be considered heavy and light if you were to carry them: boulder, pebble, feather, bowling ball, elephant, seed, sand, dirt, water, books, papers, backpack", "context": "", "response": "heavy: boulder, bowling ball, elephant, sand, dirt, water, backpack\nlight: feather, seed, books, papers", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Tell me which of these activities are exciting and which are relaxing.", "context": "", "response": "- Reading: relaxing\n- Riding on a roller coaster: exciting\n- Laying in a hammock: relaxing\n- Playing paintball: exciting\n- Go kart racing: exciting\n- Skiing: exciting\n- Watching a cooking show: relaxing\n- Taking a nap: relaxing", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which instrument is string or percussion: Zatula, Jarana huasteca", "context": "", "response": "Zatula is percussion, Jarana huasteca is string.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which of the following airlines are now defunct: Eastern Air Lines, Alaska Airlines, Virgin America Airlines, Virgin Atlantic Airlines, Pan American World Airways, Tower Air, Braniff International Airways, jetBlue, Spirit Airlines, Flybe", "context": "", "response": "Eastern Air Lines, Virgin America Airlines, Pan American World Airways, Tower Air, Braniff International Airways, Flybe", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Tell me if these are brands or companies: Kleenex, Procter & Gamble, Cadillac, Doritos, Chase?", "context": "", "response": "It can be difficult to know if something is a brand or a company.

He has also functioned in a more creative playmaking role at times, as a supporting forward or even as a number 10, in particular in his later career, after losing some of his pace and stamina with age; this deeper position allows him to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, where he can utilize his technical ability, vision, passing, and movement to create space and provide assists for teammates. While naturally right-footed, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is a powerful and accurate striker of the ball from both inside or outside the penalty area with either foot, and is also known for his accuracy from penalties and dead ball situations. An accurate finisher with his head as well as with his feet, his height, elevation, and strength often give him an advantage at winning aerial challenges, and also allow him to function as a \"target man\"; despite his large stature, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is uncommonly agile for a player of his size, and his athleticism and ability in the air have seen him score several goals from acrobatic strikes and volleys throughout his career, which earned him the moniker Ibracadabra in the Italian media. In spite of his size and physique, Ibrahimovi\u0107 possesses excellent technique and ball control, which, coupled with his balance, power, and physicality, enables him to hold up the ball well with his back to goal, retain possession, and link up with other players; he has also been praised by pundits for his creativity and dribbling skills. Although he is not gifted with exceptional pace, in particular over shorter distances, which became more evident in his later career as he slowed down with age, he is also a quick player and a fast sprinter, who possessed significant acceleration in his youth, and was able to clock top speeds over 30 km/h even into his 30s.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Tell me whether each of these refers to the book called \"Don Quixote\": \"Don Quixote\", \"El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha\", \"El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha\", \"El Quijote\", \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\", \"Don Quixote, Knight Errant\"", "context": "", "response": "\"Don Quixote\" - yes \n\"El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha\" - yes\n\"El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha\" - yes \n\"El Quijote\" - yes \n\"Don Quijote\" - yes\n\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" - no\n\"Don Quixote, Knight Errant\" - no", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Classify each of the following as either a true statement or a false statement: \n1.

The primary difference between these boats begins with the shape of the hull since many other design choices tend to be dictated by hull shape.\n\nCoastal cruisers, which are generally sailed near shore and in safer weather conditions, \ntend to have a flatter hull shapes since these boats, which means they tend to \"slap\" the water when coming off a wave.  With a flatter hull shape, boat architects can make greater use of the cabin space and so coastal cruisers will generally have a more spacious interior.  The helm (or the outdoor area from which the boat is navigated) is generally less protected and generally speaking, offers greater comfort and ease of moving around.  Safety, protection and expected time away from marinas mean these boats can refill fresh water, recharge batteries, empty waste tanks more frequently and therefore, tend to have lower capacities.\n\nBlue water boats, because they are intended to sail in open waters (hence the moniker \"blue water\") in more unpredictable weather, generally have tapered (or tear drop shaped) hull shapes with heavier keels (generally, lead) and deeper drafts.  With these designs, blue water boats can withstand heavier seas and will \"cut through\" waves rather than \"slap.\"  Generally speaking, blue water boats offer a much more comfortable experience in rougher seas and will have bigger fresh water and fuel tanks and will likely feature generators and other equipment that allows these boats to away for longer periods.\n\nBlue water boats feature tapered hulls so the beam or width of the boat narrows the closer it gets to the water line (and below), leaving less room in the interior cabin than an equally sized coastal cruiser.  Foot for foot, blue water boats will feature fewer berths and will have more cramped quarters because of the narrowing beam.\n\nBecause blue water boats are intended to sail longer distances and will carry more fuel and fresh water, these boats interior space is further restricted to accomadate these practical requirements.\n\nThe differences in comfort, stability and likelihood of capsizing are all captured in mathematical calculations that can provide an abstracted comparison between these boat types so prospective buyers can anticipate the the experiences and trade offs each hull type would provide.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorting my fresh food into two groups.

A genome is an organism's complete set of DNA, including all of its genes as well as its hierarchical, three-dimensional structural configuration. In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of all of an organism's genes, their interrelations and influence on the organism. Genes may direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. In turn, proteins make up body structures such as organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. Genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes through uses of high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes.

In part, this is because there is not one single definition of art! \n\nSome people consider art a creative process that gives only aesthetic pleasure, and does not serve any utilitarian purpose. However, even with this definition, there is not a clear dividing line between art and utilitarian creative processes. For example, some people consider the literary arts to comprise poetry, fiction, non-fiction, and drama. We can clearly understand that non-fiction has a utilitarian purpose to educate and communicate, and arguably the other literary arts do too. So that definition of art as serving no utilitarian purpose is not very black-and-white. \n\nIf we consider art to be any creative endeavor that provides aesthetic pleasure, and that it might also be utilitarian, then there are many forms of art. Below is a partial listing, together with some of the ways these are commonly grouped together. \n\n\nArt form | Can be classified as\nPoetry | Literary arts, fine arts\nFiction | Literary arts\nNon-fiction | Literary arts\nDrama / theater | Performing arts, literary arts\nSculpture | Visual arts, fine arts, plastic arts\nPainting | Visual arts, fine arts\nGlassblowing | Visual arts\nCeramics | Visual arts, plastic arts\nOrigami | Visual arts, plastic arts\nWoodworking | Sculpture, plastic arts\nMusic | Performing arts, fine arts\nDance | Performing arts, fine arts\nFilm-making / cinematography | Performing arts, visual arts, media arts\nPhotography | Visual arts, media arts\nOpera | Performing arts, visual arts\nFood preparation | Culinary arts\nFood styling | Visual arts, culinary arts\nArchitecture | Fine arts\n\nThere are also subcategories of many of these art forms, for example:\nSculpture using different materials can have its own subcategory. Some people consider glassblowing or wood carving to be subcategories of sculpture.\nWoodworking has sub-specialties including engraving, furniture-making, and carving.\n  \nThere is also disagreement about including utilitarian disciplines as a form of art. Architecture is a good example of this. It is highly regulated, requires engineering skill, and provides clear useful benefits, so it doesn\u2019t meet the standard of \u201cpurely aesthetic\u201d. Still, it is common to consider architecture an art form, and most people agree that architecture can provide aesthetic pleasure.\n\nAs you can see, there isn\u2019t a single way to classify art forms, although there is consensus about some of the most common groupings.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "List some titles from Ray Bradbury.", "context": "", "response": "Fahrenheit 451, The Martian Chronicles, Dandelion Wine, Something Wicked This Way Comes, The Halloween Tree", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which instrument is string or percussion: Tsymbaly, Yehu", "context": "", "response": "Yehu is string, Tsymbaly is percussion.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which instrument is string or percussion: Timbal, Lotar", "context": "", "response": "Lotar is string, Timbal is percussion.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "What do these seven things have to do with each other: Lake, Ocean, River, Avalanche?", "context": "", "response": "The are all objects that are made of water.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Please classify the following items as either \u201cwaterproof\u201d or \u201cwater absorbent\u201d: umbrella, paper towel, sponge, raincoat, dish rag, car windshield.", "context": "", "response": "The waterproof items are the umbrella, the raincoat and the car windshield.
