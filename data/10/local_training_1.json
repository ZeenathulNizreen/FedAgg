The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.\n\nBonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors, in the event of bankruptcy. Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, which is a perpetuity, that is, a bond with no maturity. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are classified as money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.\n\nThe most common forms include municipal, corporate, and government bonds. Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion-stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market. The price of a bond in the secondary market may differ substantially from the principal due to various factors in bond valuation.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Where does Nick work on the show the New Girl", "context": "", "response": "at the Bar", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is Mario Puzo's most famous book?", "context": "", "response": "The Godfather.

Preheat the stove to medium heat and warm the pot or pan while you do this. Then pour the eggs into the pan and continually stir the eggs, scraping the bottom of the pan to ensure the eggs are fluffy. You can also poach an egg by cracking an egg into boiling water.

For stars of this mass, their inward pull of gravity is too strong to be resisted by other forces, thus their fate is to become black holes. However, stars under this limit and above the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses will end their lifecycles as neutron stars. Neutron stars are also the remnants of dead stars but since they have a smaller mass, their gravity is not enough for them to cross into becoming black holes. As the dead star compresses and becomes more and more dense, regular matter is turned into neutrons and the last force to resist the pull of gravity is called degenerate neutron pressure, which is a quantum effect that dictates that no two neutrons may be in the same quantum state. This creates an outward pressure that resists the pull of gravity and settles the star into a neutron star. If more mass is added later, from a star companion or other sources, once the star's mass crosses the limit of around 2.2 solar masses even degenerate neutron pressure isn't enough to balance gravity and the star will collapse into a black hole.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Name the Khals known to currently be alive in A Song of Ice and Fire.", "context": "", "response": "Jhaqo, Pono, Moro, Jommo, Zekko, and Motho.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "what happens when you blow air into alkaline water?", "context": "", "response": "When you blow air into alkaline water the C02 from your breath creates carbonic acid which lowers the potential hydrogen of the alkaline water.

You can use a bike, treadmill, elliptical whichever suits your style.  In all my life of being fairly active, Sprint 8 has the toughest workout, but over a year I could see significant results.  I was able to run faster, lower blood pressure, reduce fat percentage, and improve muscle mass.  The key differentiator about this program is that it engages all the three muscle fiber types and releases exercise induced growth hormones to help your body become stronger, leaner and healthier.\n\nAnother advantage is that this program really reduces any change of injury that one may face by running, heavy weight lifting etc therefore allowing you to sustain the exercise program for years to come.  \n\nGive this a try and gain the benefits of efficient exercising.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What is the capital of Norway and when was it founded?", "context": "", "response": "Oslo is the capital of Norway.

Friendly competitions and matches organized between clubs are not included. The football associations FIFA and UEFA run international and European competitions; while The Football Association, and its mostly self-governing subsidiary bodies the English Football League and Premier League, run national competitions.\n\nThe European governing body UEFA was founded in 1954, and created their first and most prestigious competition, the European Cup, the next year. It was expanded and renamed in 1992 as the UEFA Champions League. Liverpool hold the English record, with six wins. Parallel to UEFA, various officials created the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1955, but this competition was disbanded when UEFA created the replacement tournament, UEFA Cup, in 1971 (renamed the UEFA Europa League in 2009) The English record number of Europa League wins is three, also held by Liverpool. Another competition absorbed into the UEFA Cup, in 1999, was the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, which was created in 1960 and featured the winners of national knockout competitions The winners of this competition played the European Cup winners in the UEFA Super Cup, starting in 1972 (recognised by UEFA in 1973), which now features the winners of the Champions League and Europa League.Liverpool also hold the English record, with four wins, in the UEFA Super Cup. The International Football Cup, also known as the UEFA Intertoto Cup, was a competition for clubs not participating in the European Cup, UEFA Cup or Cup Winners' Cup. The tournament commenced in 1961, but UEFA officially recognised it only in 1995, and discontinued in 2008, with the Europa League expanded to accommodate Intertoto Cup clubs. UEFA and CONMEBOL also created an intercontinental competition in 1960, the Intercontinental Cup, featuring continental champions from both associations. In 2000, the international governing body FIFA created the FIFA Club World Cup and in 2004 the Intercontinental Cup was merged into it. Manchester United are the only English club to have won the Intercontinental Cup, while United, Chelsea and Liverpool are the only English teams to have lifted the Club World Cup.\n\nEngland's first competition organised by a national body, the FA Cup, began in the 1871\u201372 season, making it one of the oldest football competitions in the world.Arsenal hold the record number of wins, with 14. League football began in the next decade with the founding of The Football League in 1888\u201389. The name First Division was adopted in 1892, when The Football League gained a second division. The First Division remained the highest division of the English league system until 1992, when the Premier League was founded. Manchester United have won the most top division titles, 20. The English equivalent of the super cup began in 1898 with the inauguration of the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, pitting the best professional and amateur sides of the year against each other. The trophy would develop into the FA Charity Shield in 1908, which was later renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. Manchester United also hold the record here, with 21 wins. The Football League created its own knockout competition in 1960, the League Cup. Its current record is nine wins, held by Liverpool. The Anglo-Italian League Cup was created in 1969 to match English cup winners against the winners of the Coppa Italia, and was permanently disbanded in 1976. In 1985, the Full Members' Cup and Football League Super Cup were created as substitutes for UEFA competitions after UEFA responded to the Heysel Stadium disaster by banning English clubs. They finished in 1992 and 1986, respectively.

The prizes have been randomly assigned to the doors and you want to win the car. The host allows you to pick one of the doors as a first selection. Then, the host opens one of the remaining doors and reveals a goat is behind it. The host now allows you to decide if you want to switch from your selected door to the remaining unopened door. Should you switch, to maximize your probability of winning the car?\n\nMost people believe switching does not improve your probability of winning the car. However switching does increase your probability of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3. An intuitive way to understand this problem is by first considering the initial state. At your first selection the probability that you have selected the right door is 1/3 and the probability that the car remains behind one of the two unselected doors is 2/3. Then the host reveals more information. The host reveals that one of the unselected doors does not have the car behind it. The probability that the originally unselected doors must have the car behind one of them is still 2/3, but you now know one of them specifically which does not have the car. Therefore, the remaining unopened unselected door must have a probability of 2/3 to contain the car, and your originally selected door must have a probability of 1/3.

The United States could therefore afford to spend more on its military than the USSR and won the nuclear arms race, which contributed to the internal collapse of the Soviet economy and the subsequent breakup of the Soviet Union into smaller, individual states with democratic elections. Additionally, though the USSR and the United States never officially engaged in direct military conflict with one another during the Cold War, various factions supported by the United States and its Western allies were able to successfully defeat Soviet-backed factions in proxy wars that took place all across the globe (with the notable exception of Vietnam). These defeats gradually limited the USSR's ability to project its power on the world stage, and helped the United States build and strengthen key alliances, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Finally, the United States carried out effective intelligence, counter-intelligence, disinformation and propaganda campaigns that undermined the faith the USSR's population had in its government and buttressed support for the U.S. government's efforts domestically.

One is a mathematically faster way to pay off the debt; whereas, the alternative is slightly slower but is more psychologically motivating. This motivation is what helps the person reach their debt pay off goals. The following set of debts will be used as the basis for explaining each method:\n\nDebt A has a balance of $10,000 at a 4% interest rate. \nDebt B has a balance of $5,000 at a 10% interest rate.\nDebt C has a balance of $8,000 at a 24% interest rate. \n\nThe Debt Avalanche is typically the fastest and most cost effective way to pay off debt. The person makes minimum payments on all their debts and any extra goes towards the account with highest interest rate (Debt C in example above). Once that first balance is paid off, the person takes the payments from that and puts it all towards the second highest interest rate (Debt B). Repeat until all debts are paid.\n\nThe Debt Snowball is a method popularized by a personal finance expert, Dave Ramsey, in Step 2 of his 7 Baby Steps to building wealth. This method uses psychology by paying off the smallest balance first (Debt B above). The theory is that the feeling of quickly paying off a debt balance provides the motivation to stick with the program.

The term covers the organism's morphology (physical form and structure), its developmental processes, its biochemical and physiological properties, its behavior, and the products of behavior. An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism's genetic code (its genotype) and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting the phenotype. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called polymorphic. A well-documented example of polymorphism is Labrador Retriever coloring; while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black, and brown. Richard Dawkins in 1978 and then again in his 1982 book The Extended Phenotype suggested that one can regard bird nests and other built structures such as caddisfly larva cases and beaver dams as \"extended phenotypes\".\n\nWilhelm Johannsen proposed the genotype\u2013phenotype distinction in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's hereditary material and what that hereditary material produces. The distinction resembles that proposed by August Weismann (1834\u20131914), who distinguished between germ plasm (heredity) and somatic cells (the body). More recently, in The Selfish Gene (1976), Dawkins distinguished these concepts as replicators and vehicles.\n\nThe genotype\u2013phenotype distinction should not be confused with Francis Crick's central dogma of molecular biology, a statement about the directionality of molecular sequential information flowing from DNA to protein, and not the reverse.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "What are some basic spirits you should have at your bar", "context": "", "response": "Often times socializing with friends and neighbors includes spirits or alcohol.

It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2021.\n\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is poorly understood. While it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment, and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that \u2019treatment\u2019 of any form of autism should not be a goal since autism is not an 'a disease that can be removed or cured\u2019. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, \u2019management of autism itself is chiefly about providing the education, training and social support/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world\u2019. Only limited data support the effectiveness of particular interventions for autism. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety. Autistic characteristics tend to become less evident in adulthood , but social and communication difficulties usually persist.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "Is learning piano on a keyboard just as effective as learning on a grand/upright piano?", "context": "", "response": "Since the layout of keys for both electronic keyboards and pianos are the same, keyboards could be effective for beginners.

In general, for people to migrate from India to the US one of the main criteria is exceptional academic performance with post graduate university qualifications in addition to being very proficient in English.So, the parents of these children of Indian origin have a strong academic educational background and try to create an environment at home that places great emphasis on academic learning.\n\nSpellBee has become very popular with the events being telecast on TV. The event is becoming more popular among the Indian community in the US as they see Indian kids being successful in the contests and getting national recognition when they perform well in SpellBee. When the Indian parents find that their kids are showing some aptitude in spelling and are capable of putting in the required effort, the parents start motivating the children to start practising for SpellBee contests. \n\nThese children of Indian origin spend significant effort over a period of several months or in some cases even years fine tuning their skills to practise for SpellBee contests.

The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.

It gathers various mathematical, statistical and image processing techniques that can be used to quantify morphological, hydrological, ecological and other aspects of a land surface. Common synonyms for geomorphometry are geomorphological analysis (after geomorphology), terrain morphometry, terrain analysis, and land surface analysis. Geomorphometrics is the discipline based on the computational measures of the geometry, topography and shape of the Earth's horizons, and their temporal change. This is a major component of geographic information systems (GIS) and other software tools for spatial analysis.\n\nIn simple terms, geomorphometry aims at extracting (land) surface parameters (morphometric, hydrological, climatic etc.) and objects (watersheds, stream networks, landforms etc.) using input digital land surface model (also known as digital elevation model, DEM) and parameterization software.[Extracted surface parameters and objects can then be used, for example, to improve mapping and modelling of soils, vegetation, land use, geomorphological and geological features and similar.\n\nWith the rapid increase of sources of DEMs today (and especially due to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and LIDAR-based projects), extraction of land surface parameters is becoming more and more attractive to numerous fields ranging from precision agriculture, soil-landscape modelling, climatic and hydrological applications to urban planning, education and space research.

This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.\n\nBecause protein structure is closely linked with protein function, the structural genomics has the potential to inform knowledge of protein function. In addition to elucidating protein functions, structural genomics can be used to identify novel protein folds and potential targets for drug discovery. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure.\n\nAs opposed to traditional structural biology, the determination of a protein structure through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.\n\nStructural genomics emphasizes high throughput determination of protein structures. This is performed in dedicated centers of structural genomics.\n\nWhile most structural biologists pursue structures of individual proteins or protein groups, specialists in structural genomics pursue structures of proteins on a genome wide scale. This implies large-scale cloning, expression and purification. One main advantage of this approach is economy of scale. On the other hand, the scientific value of some resultant structures is at times questioned. A Science article from January 2006 analyzes the structural genomics field.\n\nOne advantage of structural genomics, such as the Protein Structure Initiative, is that the scientific community gets immediate access to new structures, as well as to reagents such as clones and protein. A disadvantage is that many of these structures are of proteins of unknown function and do not have corresponding publications. This requires new ways of communicating this structural information to the broader research community.

So back to wood carving.  What can you do?  Let's say you've carved yourself a nice salmon complete with fens and gill lines.  Well here are three ways to dress it up.  First and most obvious  - paint it.  You can go for detail paint or you can use more of a water color approach that will give the wood a colored wash.  The sky is really the limit here.  Second, you mount it on a stand so it floats about the ground.  Drill a small whole in the bottom of the fish, do the same in a wood block you've sanded up and you have s stand.

More generally, it can be thought of as the study of neuronal wiring diagrams with a focus on how structural connectivity, individual synapses, cellular morphology, and cellular ultrastructure contribute to the make up of a network. The nervous system is a network made of billions of connections and these connections are responsible for our thoughts, emotions, actions, memories, function and dysfunction. Therefore, the study of connectomics aims to advance our understanding of mental health and cognition by understanding how cells in the nervous system are connected and communicate. Because these structures are extremely complex, methods within this field use a high-throughput application of functional and structural neural imaging, most commonly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electron microscopy, and histological techniques in order to increase the speed, efficiency, and resolution of these nervous system maps. To date, tens of large scale datasets have been collected spanning the nervous system including the various areas of cortex, cerebellum, the retina, the peripheral nervous system and neuromuscular junctions.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two types of connectomes; macroscale and microscale. Macroscale connectomics refers to using functional and structural MRI data to map out large fiber tracts and functional gray matter areas within the brain in terms of blood flow (functional) and water diffusivity (structural). Microscale connectomics is the mapping of small organisms' complete connectome using microscopy and histology.

It\u2019s in our windows, on our screens, in our cabinets, and in many of the devices we interact with every day. Even though glass can be found everywhere, you may live your whole life not knowing much about how it\u2019s made or what it\u2019s composed of. Even if you think you know the basics, you\u2019ve only skimmed the surface.   \n\nAt a high level, glass is sand that\u2019s been melted down and chemically transformed. If you\u2019ve ever been to the beach, you know exactly how hot sand can get while remaining in its solid form. The kind of heat necessary to transform sand into a liquid state (eventually becoming glass) is much hotter than any sunny day. To make sand melt, you need to heat it to roughly 1700\u00b0C (3090\u00b0F), which is approximately the same temperature a space shuttle reaches as it re-enters earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThe sand commonly used to make glass is comprised of small grains of quartz crystals, made up of molecules of silicon dioxide, which is also known as silica. When those molecules are heated to high enough temperatures, the sand melts and loses its crystalline structure, and as it cools it gains an entirely different structure. That structure, on a molecular level, is somewhere in between a liquid and a solid. This in-between state is known as an amorphous solid, which means it has some of the crystalline structure of a solid coupled with the molecular randomness of a liquid.\n\nGlass Melting\nDepending on the sand mixture, glass can have a variety of properties. Certain elements or chemicals mixed with sand can change glass\u2019s color, for example. Glass\u2019s properties can also change based on how it\u2019s manufactured and the processes by which it\u2019s shaped afterward. To strengthen glass, manufacturers can use thermal tempering to heat and cool it rapidly. Glass can also be strengthened chemically through an ion exchange process that makes the surface of the glass tougher.\n\nThe glass most people are familiar with is soda-lime glass, which is a combination of soda (also known as soda ash or washing soda), limestone, and sand. Although you can make glass simply by heating and then rapidly cooling silica, the manufacturing of soda-lime glass is a little more complex. By adding soda (sodium carbonate), the melting point of the sand is reduced so it can be transformed into glass at lower temperatures and save energy during manufacturing. However, adding soda to the mixture reduces its chemical durability, making it prone to dissolve when in contact with liquids. For most applications, that\u2019s not desirable, so limestone (calcium carbonate) is also added to the mixture, which acts as a stabilizer. Once the mixture of silica, soda, and limestone is heated, it can be cooled and molded for a variety of applications. \nAt Corning, we know glass. We know how to strengthen it through chemical processes like ion exchange, and we know how to bend it to make optical fiber that can stretch over vast distances. Our knowledge of glass goes back more than a century, allowing us to remain on the cutting edge of research and development. From simple soda-lime to complex glass structures that enable augmented reality, glass is an adaptable, wide-ranging material. That\u2019s why, after more than 165 years, we\u2019re still making new discoveries.", "category": "open_qa"}, {"instruction": "How did Robert Baratheon die?", "context": "", "response": "King Robert I Baratheon was on a boar hunting trip when he was gored by a boar.

Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.\n\nA mass spectrum is a type of plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. These spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical identity or structure of molecules and other chemical compounds.\n\nIn a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gaseous, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with a beam of electrons. This may cause some of the sample's molecules to break up into positively charged fragments or simply become positively charged without fragmenting. These ions (fragments) are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, for example by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an electron multiplier. Results are displayed as spectra of the signal intensity of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio.

The United States Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FWHA) classifies roads based on functions which are created based on attributes such as speed limits, route length and spacing. Based on the road functions we can categorize roads into the following categories.\n1. Interstates and Arterial System\n2. Other Arterials\n3. Collectors\n4. Locals\n\nThe interstate system is the at the top of road function classification system. They include Highways and Freeways with the highest speed limits and which allow for long distance travel without a lot of interruption. They are constructed using precise standards, signage and with safety considerations. They are also sometimes referred to as Arterial roads as they provide vital connectivity across regions in America. Interstate 95 or I-95 is an example of one such highway in the east coast of the United States which runs from Florida to Maine. The Principal Arterial system also comprises of U.S. Highways, which provide connectivity across regions which do not have an Interstate to support travel.\n\nOther Arterials also include freeways and highways which supplement the Interstate system explained above. They have a slightly lesser speed limits. They typically connect cities and urban areas. Consider them as being minor highways. As an example, North Carolina Highway 55 (NC-55) is a primary state highway artery connecting multiple regional and urban areas in the state of North Carolina.\n\nCollectors are critical for connecting urban population using local roads with the Interstate highways where applicable. They have more interruptions and are shorter in lengths. They also have lesser speed limits (30-35 mph). These can comprise of State highways which connect local roads with the Arterial highways.\n\nFinally local roads provide connectivity between communities, regions, farms and other local areas. They form the lion's share of the United States road system.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Which is a species of fish?

According to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in present-day Karnataka. However, according to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century CE. Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, in the 8th century, while the earliest mention of dosa in the Kannada literature appears a century later.\n\nIn popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants. The Tamil dosai is softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka. A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.\n\nAfter the Independence of India, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular in the North.

How did the Spanish Empire treat its overseas territories?", "context": "", "response": "The Spanish Empire lasted for four centuries, from the arrival of Columbus in America in 1492 until the loss of its last overseas territories (Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines) in 1898. In its last period, towards the middle of the 19th century, a debate arose that, to this day, still raises blisters regarding the definition of these lands. A part of the population continues to consider that the lands that Spain conquered beyond the seas were colonies, while another part defines them as provinces. That is, like Valladolid, Barcelona or Guadalajara.\nIn the Royal Decree of Carlos V, promulgated in 1519, which was later included in the Compilation of Laws of the Indies, the following declaration of intent could already be read: \u00abThat the West Indies be always united to the Crown of Castile and that cannot be alienated. We order that, at no time, they can be separated by our royal crown of Castile, disunited or divided in whole or in part or in favor of any person.\u00bb\nThe Spanish laws always spoke of \"provinces\", \"kingdoms\", \"republics\", \"empires\" or \"territories of islands and mainland\". In other words, the term \"colony\" was never used in the legal field for the territories that had been incorporated into the Crown of Castile. It was incorporated later and only with a critical and propagandistic desire, the same as it is today when it is used. This is not an excuse to deny that in the Spanish overseas territories there were models of exploitation that could be considered colonial, such as the monopoly of the extraction of precious metals or certain types of commercial companies. One of the main proofs is that the overseas territories reproduced most of the institutions of the metropolis.\nBernardino Bravo Lira, winner of Chile's 2010 National History Award, noted an important difference:\n\"Politically, the Indies were incorporated into the Crown and not into the Kingdom of Castile. This means that they were not considered as simple land, without their own political personality and, therefore, susceptible to submission to a foreign power. They were considered as other kingdoms, similar to Castile and other Europeans, endowed with the same attributes as them. For this reason they were classified and organized under the form of State of the Indies and not colonies. The kingdoms of the Indies had all the elements that then made up a State: territory, population, nationality, institutions, government and their own legislation.\"\nThis means that, contrary to what most critical authors think, the territories conquered by Spain were never considered as colonies devoid of rights. Moreover, its inhabitants were considered, already with Queen Isabella of Castilla, vassals of the Crown like any other inhabitant of the Iberian Peninsula, once the conquest process was completed in the 16th century. That is why the Indies, which have been known as \"America\" \u200b\u200bsince the 17th century, owed allegiance only to the King, who governed through the institutions created for that purpose and which were governed by officials designated for that purpose.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Of the following measurements, which units relate to mass?

However, a cutter uses two headsails, instead of a mainsail and headsail, and generally includes a bowsprit. This allows the boat to have better stability in rough weather due to the headsails providing a lower center of gravity. The complex rigging makes this boat more challenging to sail than the sloop, but provides an excellent option for an experienced sailor. \n\nA ketch has two masts. The main mast in the front stands taller than the mizzen mast behind it. The mizzen mast stands forward of the rudder post. The ketch has smaller sails and shorter masts.

Early structural biologists throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries were primarily only able to study structures to the limit of the naked eye's visual acuity and through magnifying glasses and light microscopes.\n\nIn the 20th century, a variety of experimental techniques were developed to examine the 3D structures of biological molecules. The most prominent techniques are X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron microscopy. Through the discovery of X-rays and its applications to protein crystals, structural biology was revolutionized, as now scientists could obtain the three-dimensional structures of biological molecules in atomic detail. Likewise, NMR spectroscopy allowed information about protein structure and dynamics to be obtained. Finally, in the 21st century, electron microscopy also saw a drastic revolution with the development of more coherent electron sources, aberration correction for electron microscopes, and reconstruction software that enabled the successful implementation of high resolution cryo-electron microscopy, thereby permitting the study of individual proteins and molecular complexes in three-dimensions at angstrom resolution.\n\nWith the development of these three techniques, the field of structural biology expanded and also became a branch of molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics concerned with the molecular structure of biological macromolecules (especially proteins, made up of amino acids, RNA or DNA, made up of nucleotides, and membranes, made up of lipids), how they acquire the structures they have, and how alterations in their structures affect their function. This subject is of great interest to biologists because macromolecules carry out most of the functions of cells, and it is only by coiling into specific three-dimensional shapes that they are able to perform these functions. This architecture, the \"tertiary structure\" of molecules, depends in a complicated way on each molecule's basic composition, or \"primary structure.\" At lower resolutions, tools such as FIB-SEM tomography have allowed for greater understanding of cells and their organelles in 3-dimensions, and how each hierarchical level of various extracellular matrices contributes to function (for example in bone). In the past few years it has also become possible to predict highly accurate physical molecular models to complement the experimental study of biological structures. Computational techniques such as Molecular Dynamics simulations can be used in conjunction with empirical structure determination strategies to extend and study protein structure, conformation and function.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Tell me if these are countries in the Americas or in Europe: Spain, Guyana, Peru, Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, French Guiana", "context": "", "response": "Spain: Europe, Guyana: Americas, Peru: Americas, Netherlands: Europe, Belgium: Europe, Canada: Americas, French Guiana: Americas", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "The following are some reasons to start a restaurant. the reasons should be categorized as 'great', 'neutral', 'terrible' - \n\nIt will provide food to people\nPotential to become a millionaire\nHelp you follow your passion\nAll your savings will go into opening it\nYou dont know how to cook\nThe world needs more farm to table services\nYou may be able to build a career out of it\nYou will enjoy it\nYou will lose your job\nYou dont have money to open a restaurant", "context": "", "response": "Great:\nHelp you follow your passion\nThe world needs more farm to table services\nPotential to become a millionaire\n\nNeutral:\nYou will enjoy it\nIt will provide food to people\nYou may be able to build a career out of it\n\nTerrible:\nAll your savings will go into opening it\nYou will lose your job\nYou dont know how to cook\nYou dont have money to open a restaurant", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Identify which instrument is string or woodwind: Ahenk, Arghul", "context": "", "response": "Arghul is woodwind, Ahenk is string.", "category": "classification"}, {"instruction": "Classify the following animals as either plant-only eaters or meat eaters: kangaroo, camel, bear, bison, cat, hippo, wolf, raccoon, alligator, hawk, rabbit, koala, horse, zebra, giraffe, goat, shark, dog, chicken, snake.", "context": "", "response": "Animals that eat only plants are called Herbivores.
